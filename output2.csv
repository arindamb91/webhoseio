I wanted to show that not every choice we make is an ultra-dramatic and Las Vegas-style, spectacular life-changing event. Many choices are in the everyday innocent decisions and small choices that make up an ultimately many-facetted life. Jesus made choices every day too. He wasn’t a God-robot. He had total freedom of will to choose just like we do.
Jesus “was in all points tempted like as we are” (Heb 4:15). He could have chosen to be disobedient, just as Lucifer chose in the beginning.
But rather, Jesus chose to be obedient to God because of us. He believed in what obedience would bring. He believed in his Father’s goodwill for humanity. The first chapter of John tells us Jesus was there when God created everything: elephants, rabbits, tiny neutrons, huge galaxies, mountains, flowers and everything else—all things for humanity to explore, utilize and enjoy.
Jesus knew God’s intention from the beginning. After Adam sinned and the devil began to have so much influence on earth, Jesus was willing to come to earth and go up against the devil to rescue men and women from his clutches.
To do this Jesus would have to beat Satan at every turn. He would have to live as a man and face all the temptations any man or woman would face. And He had to handle them by choosing God’s way every time. He didn’t give in to even one temptation to make a bad choice.
As we accept Jesus Christ into our hearts, He gives us the ability to turn to Him for better choices in every situation. He’s been there. He knows us.
God was sure Jesus would do the right thing, but because He loves us so much, He was willing to let Jesus come to earth and live as a man and have freedom of will. Jesus could have chosen differently if He’d wanted to. But because He loved us too, He chose to go through with God’s plan at every turn. He took the horrible results of every bad decision we make, and He paid the ultimate price of death and hell.
Then God raised Jesus pure and free forever.
Romans 8:34 says Jesus is at the right hand of God, now living to make intercession for us. He is also right here with us to help us with our choices and Colossians 1:27 says we have Christ in us. How can He be in so many places at once? He’s Spirit and even the scientists now are proving that things can be in two places at once. It’s awesome.
Just like Jesus had decisions to make, let’s make an effort to give God honor by making good decisions ourselves and when we honestly don’t know what choice to make, take it to Jesus because He always knows the best choice at that time. He’s been through it. He took our place on the cross so that He could always be there to help us.
Love, Carolyn

While I rarely take my good camera out on these excursions, it is probably important to have your phone just in case of an emergency situation. You never know when you may need it. Then, I just use my phone to take any pictures. There are dry packs you can hang around your neck or ones you can tie around your waist ... just depending on how many things you have to take with you. They haven't ever dragged me down and they've never failed me in terms of a leak.
I always test them at home, though ... just to make sure they have no leakage issues. Amazon has a lot of different options for pretty cheap. I have one that is still in good shape after getting it for a white water rafting trip nearly 20 years ago. Again, I still test it out at home before every trip."

Thanks @Quantum Torus , @Ravgnome and AM Loungers. Prerty quiet in the Lounge over the weekend. Hope you all had an enjoyable time and are ready to pounce on some opportunities.
Australian shares have ended the week higher thanks to gains in financials and energy stocks, even as Friday's session was buffeted by an earlier slide in the Chinese yuan and concerns over escalating global trade tensions.
The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index closed up 23.2 points, or 0.37 per cent to 6,285.9 points, while the All Ordinaries index finished the day 22.4 points, or 0.35 per cent, higher at 6,377.4 points.
The S&P/ASX200 finished the week 0.3 per cent higher and is again nearing a new 10-year closing high, after touching above 6,286 points earlier in the month.
A volatile day of trade for the yuan stoked fears that Beijing's currency management could become the next flash point in the trade dispute with the United States.
The Chinese currency managed to bounce in afternoon trade on suspected selling of dollars by state-owned banks.
Investors are keeping a wary eye on the European Union as it readies a set of retaliatory tariffs on US imports. Officials from the EU Trade Commission are due to arrive in Washington next week for trade talks.
""We are seeing our banks being bought as a safety trade coming out of global Asian markets and that's a dominating factor that's supporting our market at this point,"" said Mathan Somasundaram, a Blue Ocean Equities market portfolio strategist.
Financials, comprising of the benchmark's top constituents, drove the index higher, with Commonwealth Bank up 0.7 per cent at $75.90.
The Australian market has been fairly resilient in the face of intensifying global trade tensions, and has risen over the last few months even as many regional markets took a hit.
Commodity prices came under pressure overnight from fund selling amid concerns the trade dispute between the United States and China will spillover into lower demand for metals.
Bearing the brunt of the weakness in prices, the mining index slid 1.5 per cent, with BHP the biggest drag, falling 2.1 per cent to $32.91.
Gold prices slipped for a sixth session and hovered near a one-year low, as a stronger dollar and rising US interest rates pull investors away from the traditional safe-heaven.
Saracen Mineral Holdings and Northern Star Resources led the losses on Friday, down 3.9 per cent and 1.2 per cent, to $1.99 and $6.86 respectively.
At 1700 AEST the Aussie dollar was at 73.71 US cents, from 73.98 US cents on Thursday, losing ground as investors sold the local unit down on worries about US-China trade tensions and any resultant impact on Chinese economic growth.
ON THE ASX
* The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index closed up 23.2 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 6,285.9 points
* The broader All Ordinaries index was up 22.4 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 6,377.4 points
* The SPI200 futures contract was up 13 points, or 0.2 per cent, at 6,225 points
CURRENCY SNAPSHOT AT 1700 AEST:
One Australian dollar buys:
* 73.71 US cents, from 73.98 US cents on Wednesday
* 82.81 Japanese yen, from 83.48
* 63.23 euro cents, from 63.66
* 56.59 British pence, from 56.71
* 109.06 NZ cents, from 109.35
GOLD:
The spot price of gold in Sydney at 1700 AEST was $US1,224.36 per fine ounce, from $US1,223.72 per fine ounce on Thursday.
U.S. stocks ended slightly lower on Friday as escalating trade anxieties driven by U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats against China offset a string of robust earnings led by Microsoft.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its third consecutive weekly gain, while the S&P 500 also rose for a third straight week after eking out a gain for the period.
Shares of Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) hit a record high and ended the session up 1.8 percent on the heels of a strong second-quarter earnings beat. The company narrowed the race with Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) and Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) in the race to be worth $1 trillion in market value.
Trump said he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of Chinese imports, the latest salvo in a series of protectionist moves that have prompted retaliatory measures from U.S. trading partners around the world.
“I think there’s a divided line on the Street,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. “One side believes that (the trade dispute) is only going to lead to a global recession, where the other side believes that the president is trying to get the other side to negotiate.”
Trump also repeated his criticism of planned interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, writing in a Twitter post that tightening U.S. monetary policy would diminish any U.S. trade advantage.
Long-dated U.S. government bond yields rose on worries that the president’s comments would encourage Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to slow the pace of rate hikes by the U.S. central bank, which could increase inflationary pressure.
“The president can’t control interest rates,” Pavlik said. “He’s not a king. So I think the Street’s reaction to that is a major overreaction.”
As the second-quarter reporting season picks up steam, analyst forecasts have grown rosier. Earnings for S&P 500 companies are now estimated to have grown 22.0 percent in the quarter, compared with the 20.7 percent seen on July 1, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
So far, 87 companies of the S&P 500 have posted results, of which 83.9 percent have beat consensus estimates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 6.38 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,058.12, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 2.66 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,801.83 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 5.10 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,820.20.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 21 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 109 new highs and 38 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.00 billion shares, compared with the 6.42 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
The Australian share market is tipped for a modest decline upon opening, following weak leads from North America and Europe.
CommSec chief economist Craig James said the futures index was pointing to a loss of 18 points, while a firming Australian dollar would deter foreign investors putting their money to work in the local market.
""We've had some declines across Europe and the United States, so it doesn't set us up really positively,"" Mr James told AAP on Sunday.
""It's not going to be too negative for the longer-term outlook.""
Mr James said the energy sector could provide some assistance to the market, following a lift in crude oil and base metal prices.
""If there's going to be an area of support, it will be the energy and mining sector,"" he said.
And while ongoing concerns of a trade war between the US and China may be weighing on the global economy, Mr James expects Australia to avoid most of the pain.
""Provided the US and China continue to grow, there is no major concern for us here in Australia,"" he said.
""In fact, some of their products are getting more expensive with higher tariffs so it could open opportunities here in Australia.""
However, Mr James said talk of a full-blown trade war was unsettling for business.
The week ahead is all about prices, Mr James said, with the consumer price index expected to be released on Wednesday before export and import prices.
""It's all about measuring inflation,"" Mr James said, tipping the rate to hold close to two per cent.
""We're gradually seeing the inflation rate edging a little bit closer to that two to three per cent target band.
Mr James said he still believes the Reserve Bank would keep interest rates on hold until at least 2019.

Review by Suze
When Jess asks Lillo to come to her wedding Lillo is surprised, because they haven’t spoken in years. The wedding is at a fancy hotel with many guests, but the bride doesn’t seem to be happy. After a terrible incident Lillo and Jess’s friends Allie and Diana decide it’s time to get out of there and save Jess from a future with a man who doesn’t love her and will never make her happy. They take Lillo’s borrowed bartered car and drive to Lighthouse Island. Jess and her friends want to stay with Lillo, who isn’t used to company anymore. Can Lillo handle having guests for a few days and will she have anything in common with three rich women who are used to a lot more luxury than she can offer them?
While Lillo tries to be a good host a lot of hurt from the past comes to the surface. Jess’s parents have always been demanding and cold and it’s time for her to choose her own future, but will she be able to? Allie hasn’t been happy in a long time, can she find back a part of herself that she thought she’d lost forever on Lighthouse Beach? Diana is a free spirit, she knows what she wants and who she wants to spend her time with. What will happen when she meets a complex and wounded man who makes her heart beat faster? Lillo is traumatized, but isn’t inclined to share her problems with anyone, will her new best friends be able to make a difference in her life? Can Lighthouse Beach heal the four friends and give them a better perspective on what their futures should look like?
Lighthouse Beach is a beautiful story about friendship, hopes, dreams and making the right choices. Lillo is a sweet and generous woman. She’s broken-hearted, but she’s there for Jess when she needs her. I loved that she steps out of her comfort zone over and over again to be there for her friend. Jess’s confidence needs a boost, she has to learn to stand up for herself and getting her out of the life she’s used to is the only way to save her. She needs three strong friends to change her views and it was interesting to see how she learns to believe in herself. Diana has plenty of confidence and her lively spirit makes everyone come out of their shell, I loved her fierceness and outspokenness. She’s decisive, which Allie could also use, because of the difficult situation she’s in. Together they are stronger than apart and that is the biggest strength of Lighthouse Beach. Each friend has something to give to the other and that’s a fabulous idea for a story.
Shelley Noble has a fantastic heartwarming writing style. I was captivated by Lighthouse Beach from beginning to end. I couldn’t put it down, each page brings something new and interesting. I enjoyed every surprising twist and turn. The story is filled with soul searching and support, which is something I liked a lot. Lighthouse Beach is a wonderful hopeful story with a gorgeous setting, Lighthouse Island and its regular visitors and inhabits are incredibly fascinating. I loved reading about this magical healing place, it’s the perfect setting for a mesmerizing story about life, love and friendship. Lighthouse Beach put a big smile on my face, I highly recommend this amazing book.
Advice
If you love beautiful emotional stories about the power of friendship combined with a gorgeous setting, you don't want to miss Lighthouse Beach.

One girl doing well; another trying to survive. Sales and subscribers and shares all very much needed now.",2018-07-22T23:41:00.000+03:00,blogs,US,,Ajijaakwe (noreply@blogger.com),"Photo copyright Aji, 2018; all rights reserved.
Yesterday's sun and shadow; clouds, but no rain. It's in the 90s every day; the heat is all June, but the drought is so terrible that the trees are already turning. It started a week or two ago across the highway (they always change first even in actual fall), but by yesterday, our big north willow had started to turn, too. We get all of summer's heat with none of the rest of it now, and at this rate, I'm not sure we'll have a winter, either.
We're both profoundly grateful that we have an adobe house to live in now instead of a 35-year-old ramshackle uninsulated metal RV. I'm not sure we'd still be alive if we'd had to live these last months, medical issues and all, in that mold trap.
The new girl is settling in; she has discovered that she likes grain, and carrots, and she no longer needs to be reminded that there's free access to water. She still doesn't much like Miskwaki being out of her sight. We'll be working on integrating them this week. Now that she's in her fifth day of decent food and water, I would swear that she's lost a little weight. She's certainly looking healthier all around. [The way a horse's digestive system is set up, malnutrition can lead to the kind of bloating that looks like pregnancy; it can also, of course, lead to impaction, displacement, and torsion, so the bloating is the least of it.] Still head-shy, but also letting me pet the front of her face without flinching. Miskwaki is back mostly to his old mellow self, too.
Less mellow for our injured raven (raven, as in bird, not Raven, as in dog). It appears that her left foot is completely broken. She can still fly, but she's much more vulnerable. She knows now to come around for food and water, and her mate is more willing to leave her as long as she's here, so hopefully this will keep her safe. We have no idea how it happened, and there's not going to be anything we can do for the foot (it would probably kill her to leave her mate for the wildlife rehabilitators down south of here, even if she were willing to trust us to catch her), but we're trying to make sure that she survives while it heals as best it can on its own.
Speaking of pain, like I've said, I'm still not sleeping, and still dealing with jacked pain levels and repeated small episodes like what happened to me in November. I'm also not worth much in terms of anything physical, and having only one really functional hand makes me even less useful. All this puts me way behind, as always, so here comes the cut-and-paste. W e very much, very badly need sales and new Patreon subscribers, and if you subscribe today, you won't be billed until August 1st. We have got to make some sales , though. This weekend is the Fiesta, and it's had . . . hmm, issues, as they say, as well. Powwow should've been last weekend, but was of course canceled with virtually no warning to anybody. Business is nonexistent all over town, and without those sales and subscribers, I honestly don't know how we get through this drought, both literal and metaphorical, with no tourist trade and not much else, either. H ere are the links and a request to share them :
My new Patreon, The Interstices (Writing Between Worlds) ; Wings's site , for sales, with new items posted; Wings's direct PayPal link ; A way to buy me coffee (which actually goes to all of our medical bills, which continue to mount); Amazon wishlist , which mostly consists of animal and household stuff; Partial registry #1 , from Bed, Bath and Beyond. There are new kitchen-y things on it now, stuff that I didn't realize we'd need to replace (either because the RV ruined it or because we gave it away when we had to downsize). I had said that I'd really like to raise another $500 in subscriptions before July is out, just to have a little more to throw to the medical wolves that are constantly at my throat. That never ends, either, and the stress is not helping with the cardio stuff. Now, we've got a lot more that needs to be done, too, and I'm damned if I know how. The truck was more than enough to throw a wrench in the works (and that's still unfixed, for the most part, given that just the one part is more than $1,200, so . . . ), but this thing with Shade? Out of left field. And once you're in it, you have to keep going; there's no way out but forward, whatever the result. So please, please share the links. Thanks to everyone for the prayers and kind words and other help for Shade. I know she was better off for it, and I know she appreciated that . Miskwaki, too, and now his new girl, who never knew how good life could be until now.

And I'm doing it on the cheap, as much as I can. If anyone's interested I'd be happy to report back, successful or otherwise... but first I know I'll need some advice (and if anyone knows of a more appropriate forum for this kind of think, any pointers appreciated) 1. To make the case compact I'll need to try to re-position the sticking-out SATA sub-board above the mainboard. This is what it looks like now https://photos.app.goo.gl/Nb8XMWQ3k8D7h7SC9 There's a white male-female connector joining it to the mainboard - does anyone know if this is proprietary or might it be a standard connector? If so, might there be a male-female cable I can slot in the middle? https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nHKob7 ... p=drivesdk 2. I will then have the same problem with the power sub-board https://drive.google.com/file/d/1geDGJR ... p=drivesdk https://photos.app.goo.gl/KPat4m3rsKncVnJJA so might the be a male-female ribbon cable or something? Any ideas appreciated With both these sub-boards, if I fail then the case just has to be bigger. No crisis. But hopefully someone out there can advise...

With a private screening of the latest Jumanji movie planned using the soundbar, I was super excited! Our jungle experience with 3D effect sound thanks to the new Sony soundbar
Who knew that a short train ride from London can transport you to the African planes, surrounded by endangers species from lions to Giraffe, tigers, buffalo and monkeys to name but a few.
The Port Lympne animal reserve and safari park was the setting for our ‘jungle’ experience with Sony, and I’ll cover our stay at Port Lympne in an upcoming post.
Checked in, showered and dinner consumed, we refilled our glasses and made our way across the hall to watch our movie using the Sony HT-ZF9 soundbar. How the new Sony sound bar can look in your home. Small and discrete, but super punchy
The soundbar has Dolby Atmos through Sony’s Virtual technology which brings a new level of inspirational, cinematic audio to your home. With the new Vertical Surround Engine from Sony, you can enjoy virtual three-dimensional surround sound that takes your breath away – without the need for ceiling or up-firing speakers. The perfect Sony set up for incredible cinematic sound that fills the room
With Dolby Atmos and DTS:X™ support, the HT-ZF9 soundbar is capable of totally immersing the audience on your sofa in sound from all around.
The Vertical Surround Engine in the HT-ZF9 soundbar can really produce a sense of helicopters whizzing above. Combining that with S-Force Pro Front Surround technology which improves the front surround sound field, means you may find it hard to believe this sound comes out of a 3.1ch soundbar. Additionally, even without Dolby Atmos and DTS:X content you can enjoy virtual three-dimensional sound due to ”Vertical S.” button on remote, that can up-mix even 2ch stereo content up to 7.1.2ch and thereby create height.
For our experience we also had a pair of SA-Z9R rear speakers, which are exclusively designed to partner with the HT-ZF9, which enhanced the experience with a true surround sound speaker configuration, filling the room with three dimensional sound.

By Faith Karimi and Debra Goldschmidt, CNN
(CNN) -- US health officials are warning people to avoid certain foods due to ongoing unrelated outbreaks of intestinal infections caused by bacteria, viruses and even parasites lurking in some of our food.
Here's what to stay away from:
Pasta salad
Hy-Vee, a Midwestern grocery store chain, has recalled a pasta salad that might be linked to at least 20 people getting sick from salmonella. Hy-Vee, based in Iowa, sold the 1-pound and 3-pound plastic containers of Spring Pasta Salad in eight states.
The states are Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota -- where the salmonella illnesses were reported -- and Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Wisconsin.
The product was produced between June 1 and July 13. The packages have expiration dates between June 22 and August 3.
Symptoms of salmonella begin 12 to 72 hours after a person is infected and include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramping. This can last about four to seven days, and most individuals recover without treatment. However, those who develop severe diarrhea may need to be hospitalized. Those who are very young, who are very old or who have compromised immune systems are most at risk for complications and severe cases of illness.
Raw turkey
Salmonella is the culprit in 90 illnesses linked to raw turkey products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Agriculture.
The illnesses have been reported in 26 states since November. But health officials have not identified a brand, product or supplier as the source of the outbreak.
Patients who have been interviewed reported eating ""different types and brands of turkey products purchased from many different locations. Two ill people lived in a household where raw turkey pet food was fed to pets,"" the CDC said.
In addition, samples of raw turkey pet food, raw turkey products and live turkeys have tested positive for the outbreak strain of salmonella, which could mean the outbreak is ""widespread in the turkey industry,"" the CDC said.
Cut melon
Put down the fork and step away from cut melon or fruit salad mixes that contain it.
The US Food and Drug Administration is warning people in 23 states that the fruit may be contaminated with salmonella.
The outbreak has affected 60 people mostly in five Midwestern states, with about half of them hospitalized.
Cut watermelon, honeydew and cantaloupe as well as fruit salads containing these melons have been recalled in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
The fruits were sold in stores such as Walmart, Kroger, Walgreens, Sprouts Farmers Market, Costco and Whole Foods/Amazon.
Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal
Federal health officials want you to toss out all boxes of Kellogg's Honey Smacks. The warning is due to an outbreak of salmonella that has left 100 people sick in 33 states.
The cereal was recalled June 14, but one month later, another warning not to eat the cereal was issued after the FDA said it was aware that it was still available.
""Retailers cannot legally offer the cereal for sale and consumers should not purchase Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal,"" the agency said.
Swiss rolls
Flowers Foods announced a recall of Swiss rolls because they may be contaminated with salmonella. The ingredient whey powder was recalled for possible contamination. There have been no reports of illness from Swiss rolls, according to the company.
Swiss rolls sold nationwide under the brand names Mrs. Freshley's, Food Lion, H-E-B, Baker's Treat, Market Square, and Great Value have been recalled. Captain John Derst's Old Fashioned Bread distributed in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina have also been recalled, the company said.
Ritz Cracker Sandwiches
Mondelez Global LLC announced a voluntary recall of certain Ritz Cracker Sandwiches and other Ritz Bits products because they contain whey powder that has been recalled for possible salmonella contamination. The products are available nationwide.
The voluntary recall is a precaution, as no complaints of illness have been reported, the company said.
The recalled product list includes Ritz Bits cheese cracker sandwiches and mixed cookie and cracker variety packs.
McDonald's salads
As a precaution, McDonald's has stopped selling salads in 3,000 locations in 14 states to try to contain an outbreak of cyclospora illness.
The states no longer selling these salads are Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Kentucky, West Virginia and Missouri.
To date, 163 cases have been confirmed in 10 states since May 1, according to the CDC.
The cyclospora parasite causes intestinal illness as a result of consuming contaminated food or water. Symptoms can begin a week or more after consuming the parasite. They include diarrhea and frequent, sometimes explosive bowel movements, according to the CDC. Those who are infected might also experience loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps or pain, nausea, gas and fatigue. Vomiting, headache, fever, body aches and flu-like symptoms can also occur.
The illness can last from a few days to a few months, and patients might feel better but then get worse again. Patients can be treated with antibiotics.
Vegetable trays
Before you grab something off that vegetable tray, make sure it hasn't been recalled.
The FDA is investigating at least 237 cases of cyclospora illnesses linked to recalled Del Monte Fresh vegetable trays. The trays contained broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and dill dip, and they were sold in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana.
""FDA has not identified which of the ingredients is the vehicle for this outbreak; each component of these vegetable trays is under consideration,"" the agency said.
Cyclospora cayetanensis is a microscopic parasite that contaminates food or water and, when ingested, causes an intestinal illness. Symptoms include diarrhea, with sometimes explosive bowel movements, loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps, bloating, nausea and fatigue.
Imported crab meat
Avoid eating fresh crab meat from Venezuela. That's the advice from the FDA due to an outbreak of Vibrio parahaemolyticus that started in April. In all, 12 illnesses have been reported in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Louisiana and the District of Columbia.
""This product is commonly found in plastic tubs and may be labeled as 'pre-cooked,' "" the FDA said in its outbreak announcement.
Symptoms usually begin 24 hours after consuming the bacteria. They include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, fever and abdominal pain. Twelve people have become sick.

Manaus is a gold mine of brightly colored architecture, riverfront views and world-class eating, minus the huge crowds. At the turn of the 20th century, Manaus was the center of a lucrative global trade in rubber. Today, it's the gateway for thousands of tourists seeking Amazon jungle adventures at the many lodges outside the city. ”
For a key attraction we loved in Manaus, this article shared: ""Manaus' Amazonas Theater (aka Teatro Amazonas or simply The Opera House) is an opulent ode to the rubber boom of the 1800s when rubber barons and the local government had more money than they knew what to do with. Some of that windfall was used for the construction of the theater. It took 15 years to complete and includes tiles, stained glass and other elements brought from Europe.""

The display seems nice, and pen support is a plus to some people.
However, once you upgrade the RAM to a usable amount (8GB) and the SSD from the terrible eMMC which in many scenarios will probably be worse than a HDD (for example sequential reads and writes) then it's suddenly 550 dollars.
On top of that the device is almost completely unusable without the keyboard cover (using Windows 10 with only touch is about as pleasant as passing a kidney stone), so that's another 100 dollars.
So 650 dollars for an Atom based laptop, with a mediocre keyboard that you can't really use on your lap (kickstand becomes way too wobbly, and the keyboard isn't rigid enough).
Not to mention all the issues the previous Surface models have had, like awful WiFi, the battery issues which lead to a class action lawsuit , terrible reliability , and so on.

On 7/21/2018 at 2:44 AM, GoodBytes said: Yes. But 2 things:
The store now has all (beside web browsers) apps that that you typical user need and more. Office, iTunes, Spotify, Whatsapp, Amazon Music, VLC, Fitbit, Kodi, Slack, Telegram, Evernote, Paint.net, and more, not to mention apps for instead of websites (Facebook, Messenger, Netflic, Hulu, Crunchyroll, Instagram). I already cross music sheet programs with pen support, like Staffpad.
Free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. So, in a way, you can see that the device comes with Windows 10 Pro instead of Home.
Yup, for sure!
1. I wouldn't say it features all the programs typical users need. I mean, grandma and grandpa basically just needs a browser these days.
For some slightly more demanding users the selection of programs in the store quickly falls apart.
No 7zip/Winrar (I assume the ""Activate_WinRAR"" app is a scam, which the store is full of I might add).
No OBS.
No Thunderbird.
Essentially no games (and no Steam).
No Discord.
VLC is a gimped version rather than the full version.
No VM software from what I can find (no VMWare workstation or virtualbox)
No Photoshop or basically any other Adobe software for that matter.
No Audacity.
No KeePass.
No good text editor from what I can tell. No Notepad++ or Atom for example.
No PIA client, although that might be possible to fix through the Windows built in VPN client.
I can keep going but I think you get the point. None of the stuff I mentioned is even that obscure. Just a bunch of programs you will find on computers of forum users on here. And no, LTT forum users is not a high bar for power users. I'd say LTT forums is an average teen with a slight interest in computers, mostly so that they can play games.
2. Will the free upgrade me a limited offer, like it was on the Surface laptop?
Anyway, I really dislike this push for Windows 10S. Even if it is free now, I am 100% sure that Microsoft's long term goal is for the store to be the standard, and using anything but the store will be a pain in the ass. I mean, even in the system they have right now it's a pain. It's a pretty simple button, sure, but once it starts costing money grandma and grandpa will suddenly be prompted to type in their credit card info into a mysterious popup in order to run a program they have already bought, on their brand new computer they just paid for. It's a huge slap in the face."

Yeah, but that just does regular OBDII codes, won't do manufacturer specific codes. These days you're better off with a code reader that can do manufacturer specific codes, that way you can also get transmission error codes, SRS, ABS etc. A regular scanner won't do those.
This is not a reader, its a communication interface. You can get some manufacturer and auxiliary (trans, abs, airbag) using software for some brands. Of course, you need more capable interfaces (manufacturer specific like VCDS from ROSStech, or multibrand like Delphi DS150E) to do modules/key programming/service reset for some brands."

The best revenge is success.
And no one is enjoying that type of revenge more than Judge Jeanine Pirro, who was verbally assaulted and “spit” on by lunatic liberal “The View” host Whoopi Goldberg.
After her appearance on ABC’s “The View,” where Whoopi Goldberg attacked her both on and off the set, Judge Jeanine’s new book has skyrocketed to #1 Amazon’s bestsellers list.
From Bizpacreview.com
Success is the best revenge. Just ask Judge Jeanine Pirro, whose book, Liars, Leakers, and Liberals , shot to No. 1 on the Amazon bestsellers list after Trump-hating liberal Whoopi Goldberg yelled and spit on her.
During the opening statement on her Fox News show, Judge Jeanine sarcastically thanked Whoopi for helping her new book become an instant bestseller.
“I do want to thank Whoopi and the ladies of The View for helping to make my book Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy hit No. 1 on Amazon and Barnes & Noble,” Pirro said. “So go out and get a copy if you haven’t already.”
As BizPac Review previously reported, Pirro said Goldberg repeatedly yelled “F- you!” and spit at her during an off-camera scuffle following their explosive on-air confrontation on “The View.”
Judge Jeanine had gone on the liberal talk show to promote her book but instead was yelled at, silenced, and thrown off the set for supporting President Trump.

On her Fox News show “Justice With Judge Jeanine,” Pirro said she’s not scared of Whoopi or anyone else who tries to silence her. “I’m a big girl. No one intimidates me,” Pirro said.
The former prosecutor and judge then slammed today’s radical liberals for fomenting faux outrage and inciting violent bullying and harassment of Trump supporters.
“The level of hatred toward the 45th president of the United States is beyond anything we’ve seen in American history,” Pirro said.
Pirro said liberals who embrace mob bullying of political opponents and protest ICE and longstanding federal immigration laws aren’t just undermining Trump, but the entire country.
“What you’re doing is tearing down America. You’re tearing down the values of the United States. Everyone has the right to speak.
But when you can’t even listen to what someone has to say because you despise the man who is president, you undermine not the president…you undermine the United States. “
Judge Jeanine closed by saying that we should “agree to disagree” with political opponents.
She then took a dig at Goldberg, who said the following on Friday’s episode of the The View: “Jeanine, good luck with your book. I hear it is No. 1. I preferred your last book about Robert Durst, but there is no accounting for taste.”
Pirro responded by saying:
“To Whoopi, I accept that you and I have different versions of what happened both on and off the air and we have completely different takes on President Trump and the job he’s doing. So let’s agree to disagree and put this episode to bed once and for all.
Thanks, Whoopi, and may I say that I preferred you in the movie ‘Ghost’ much more than on ‘The View.’ But then again, we are all entitled to our opinions.”
Judge Jeanine is right about leftists wanting to destroy America.

(CNN) × These Foods Linked to Ongoing Outbreaks Might Make You Sick US health officials are urging people to eat with caution in response to a string of ongoing outbreaks of intestinal infection. (CNN)
US health officials are warning people to avoid certain foods due to ongoing unrelated outbreaks of intestinal infections caused by bacteria, viruses and even parasites lurking in some of our food.
Here’s what to stay away from: Pasta salad
Hy-Vee, a Midwestern grocery store chain, has recalled a pasta salad that might be linked to at least 20 people getting sick from salmonella. Hy-Vee, based in Iowa, sold the 1-pound and 3-pound plastic containers of Spring Pasta Salad in eight states.
The states are Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota — where the salmonella illnesses were reported — and Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Wisconsin.
The product was produced between June 1 and July 13. The packages have expiration dates between June 22 and August 3.
Symptoms of salmonella begin 12 to 72 hours after a person is infected and include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramping. This can last about four to seven days, and most individuals recover without treatment. However, those who develop severe diarrhea may need to be hospitalized. Those who are very young, who are very old or who have compromised immune systems are most at risk for complications and severe cases of illness. Raw turkey
Salmonella is the culprit in 90 illnesses linked to raw turkey products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Agriculture.
The illnesses have been reported in 26 states since November. But health officials have not identified a brand, product or supplier as the source of the outbreak.
Patients who have been interviewed reported eating “different types and brands of turkey products purchased from many different locations. Two ill people lived in a household where raw turkey pet food was fed to pets,” the CDC said.
In addition, samples of raw turkey pet food, raw turkey products and live turkeys have tested positive for the outbreak strain of salmonella, which could mean the outbreak is “widespread in the turkey industry,” the CDC said. Cut melon
Put down the fork and step away from cut melon or fruit salad mixes that contain it.
The US Food and Drug Administration is warning people in 23 states that the fruit may be contaminated with salmonella.
The outbreak has affected 60 people mostly in five Midwestern states, with about half of them hospitalized.
Cut watermelon, honeydew and cantaloupe as well as fruit salads containing these melons have been recalled in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
The fruits were sold in stores such as Walmart, Kroger, Walgreens, Sprouts Farmers Market, Costco and Whole Foods/Amazon. Kellogg’s Honey Smacks cereal
Federal health officials want you to toss out all boxes of Kellogg’s Honey Smacks. The warning is due to an outbreak of salmonella that has left 100 people sick in 33 states .
The cereal was recalled June 14, but one month later, another warning not to eat the cereal was issued after the FDA said it was aware that it was still available.
“Retailers cannot legally offer the cereal for sale and consumers should not purchase Kellogg’s Honey Smacks cereal,” the agency said. Swiss rolls
Flowers Foods announced a recall of Swiss rolls because they may be contaminated with salmonella. The ingredient whey powder was recalled for possible contamination. There have been no reports of illness from Swiss rolls, according to the company.
Swiss rolls sold nationwide under the brand names Mrs. Freshley’s, Food Lion, H-E-B, Baker’s Treat, Market Square, and Great Value have been recalled. Captain John Derst’s Old Fashioned Bread distributed in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina have also been recalled, the company said. Ritz Cracker Sandwiches
Mondelēz Global LLC announced a voluntary recall of certain Ritz Cracker Sandwiches and other Ritz Bits products because they contain whey powder that has been recalled for possible salmonella contamination. The products are available nationwide.
The voluntary recall is a precaution, as no complaints of illness have been reported, the company said.
The recalled product list includes Ritz Bits cheese cracker sandwiches and mixed cookie and cracker variety packs. McDonald’s salads
As a precaution, McDonald’s has stopped selling salads in 3,000 locations in 14 states to try to contain an outbreak of cyclospora illness.
The states no longer selling these salads are Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Kentucky, West Virginia and Missouri.
To date, 163 cases have been confirmed in 10 states since May 1, according to the CDC .
The cyclospora parasite causes intestinal illness as a result of consuming contaminated food or water. Symptoms can begin a week or more after consuming the parasite. They include diarrhea and frequent, sometimes explosive bowel movements, according to the CDC. Those who are infected might also experience loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps or pain, nausea, gas and fatigue. Vomiting, headache, fever, body aches and flu-like symptoms can also occur.
The illness can last from a few days to a few months, and patients might feel better but then get worse again. Patients can be treated with antibiotics. Vegetable trays
Before you grab something off that vegetable tray, make sure it hasn’t been recalled.
The FDA is investigating at least 237 cases of cyclospora illnesses linked to recalled Del Monte Fresh vegetable trays . The trays contained broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and dill dip, and they were sold in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana.
“FDA has not identified which of the ingredients is the vehicle for this outbreak; each component of these vegetable trays is under consideration,” the agency said.
Cyclospora cayetanensis is a microscopic parasite that contaminates food or water and, when ingested, causes an intestinal illness. Symptoms include diarrhea, with sometimes explosive bowel movements, loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps, bloating, nausea and fatigue. Imported crab meat
Avoid eating fresh crab meat from Venezuela. That’s the advice from the FDA due to an outbreak of Vibrio parahaemolyticus that started in April. In all, 12 illnesses have been reported in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Louisiana and the District of Columbia.
“This product is commonly found in plastic tubs and may be labeled as ‘pre-cooked,’” the FDA said in its outbreak announcement .
Symptoms usually begin 24 hours after consuming the bacteria. They include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, fever and abdominal pain. Twelve people have become sick.

But Snapchat will abandon the peer-to-peer payment space on August 30th. Code buried in Snapchat’s Android app includes a “Snapcash deprecation message” that displays “Snapcash will no longer be available after %s [date]”. Shutting down the feature will bring an end to Snapchat’s four-year partnership with Square to power the feature for sending people money.
Snapcash may have become more of a liability than a utility. With apps like Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, and Square Cash itself, there were plenty of other ways to pay back friends for drinks or Ubers, so Snapcash may have seen low legitimate usage. Meanwhile, a quick Twitter search for “Snapcash” surfaced plenty of offers of erotic content in exchange for payments through the feature. It may have been safer for Snapchat to ditch Snapcash than risk PR problems over its misuse.
TechCrunch tipster Ishan Agarwal provided the below screenshot of Snapchat’s code to TechCrunch. When presented with the code and asked if Snapcash would shut down, a Snapchat spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that it would, explaining: “Yes, we’re discontinuing the Snapcash feature as of August 30, 2018. Snapcash was our first product created in partnership with another company – Square. We’re thankful for all the Snapchatters who used Snapcash for the last four years and for Square’s partnership!” The spokesperson noted that users would be notified in-app and through the support site soon.
Snapcash gave Snapchat a way to get users to connect payment methods to the app. That’s increasingly important as the company aims to become a commerce platforms where you can shop without leaving the app. Having payment info on file is what makes buying things through Snapchat easier than the web and draws brands to use Snapchat storefronts.
We’ll see how Snapchat plans evolve its commerce strategy without this driver. Earlier this month, TechCrunch revealed that Snapchat’s code contained mentions of a project codenamed “eagle” that’s a camera search feature. It was designed to allow users to scan an object or barcode with their Snapchat camera and see product results in Amazon. But since our report, mentions of Amazon have disappeared from the code. It’s unclear what will happen in the future, but camera search could give Snapchat new utility and monetization options.
Snapcash won’t be a part of that future, though. Given Snapchat’s cost-cutting efforts including layoffs , its desperate need to attract and retain advertisers to hit revenue estimates its missed, and its persistent bad rap as a sexting app, it couldn’t afford to support unnecessary features or another scandal.

The healthcare industry is facing disruption due to accelerating technological innovation and growing demand for improved delivery of healthcare and lower costs. Tech startups are leading the way by seizing opportunities in the areas of the industry that are most vulnerable to disruption, including genomics, pharmaceuticals, administration, clinical operations, and insurance.
Venture funds and businesses are taking notice of these startups' potential. In the US, digital health funding reached $1.6 billion in Q1 2018, according to Rock Health — the largest first quarter on record, surpassing the $1.4 billion in venture funding seen in Q1 2016.

Software Upgrade 16 July - New Enhanced Features for Existing and New Users,2018-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00,discussions,GB,,Grampus,"I was a little sceptical that they could sound as good as others had described in their reviews, but I was very wrong! Without doubt the best headphones I have ever put on my head. Although I have not timed the battery life, Nura claim 15-20 hours per charge, however it is very good, I use mine for a minimum of an hour a day and charge them every 7 to 10 days.
If you are a little unsure as to the sound quality, buy a pair, you can always return them to Amazon, but I bet you won't!
The best headphones, just got better since the release of the G2 firmware, they were very good at noise isolation, but the firmware upgrade adds ANC active noise cancelling and several more options.
I found the following write up in New Atlas (formally Gizmag) and as an owner agree with everything in the article.
After first testing Nura's near-magical auto-adaptive headphones in 2016, we jumped straight in and bought a couple pairs. To this date, they're still the best headphones we've ever heard, but what we didn't expect was a free software update that would take things up a notch with active noise canceling, social mode and a bunch of other new features.
I have several pairs of Bluetooth headphones around the house, and I can honestly say I've never gone out of my way to run a software update on any of them. This G2 update from Nura is a very different proposition.
Free to all Nura owners, it takes what's already a transcendent headphone experience and … well, the best way to describe it is that it tidies up around the edges and adds some exciting new functionality. We've been pre-release testing the G2 update for the last week.
Active Noise Canceling (ANC)
Honestly, the way these cans are designed almost precludes the need for noise canceling. As well as the over-ear cups, Nuraphones add in a springy silicon earbud that pokes right into your ears, giving them terrific sound isolation even without an active system.
But it turns out, all the requisite microphones and componentry to give these things active silencers were already built in – perhaps we should've been tipped off by the fact that they work so well as phone headsets while making calls.
With the G2 update, noise-canceling is turned on by default. Interestingly, there's no easy switch or button option that lets you turn it on or off on the go. It's either on or it's not. Which is fine; you can play with it in the app to see if it's worth the hit to your battery life.
Some ANC systems can introduce their own sound. For example, I've got a set of Sennheisers that give a quiet low-frequency buzz when they can't find any stable noise to cancel. There's nothing with the Nura system, not a sausage. And the system does a great job of eliminating constant noise, such as the roar of an aircraft cabin or road noise, to the point where it's so quiet I can hear little else but my own tinnitus. That's ok; play something through the headphones and my brain has something else to concentrate on.
Social Mode
These were already pretty savage cans to wear in an office situation; the in/over ear design's high degree of isolation alone makes it pretty tough for colleagues to get your attention. The new ANC takes things to a new level, and thus it's terrific to have the option of turning on a new ""social mode"" to blend outside sound with the music you're listening to.
It's very well implemented here. I've got it set as a double-tap on my left ear, and when you turn it on, the volume of the media signal is dropped, and the outside world suddenly appears in your ears – including your own voice. It feels surprisingly natural to have a conversation with headphones on – the only real difference is that your own voice is a little boomier in your head, but you can easily judge how loud you need to be talking, which is a big deal.
There are also more devious uses. Put these cans on and you look like you can't hear anything in the office. Click Social mode on, and you can hear everything, crystal clear, and get some sense of what your co-workers really think of you. Try it at your own risk.
Multiple Bluetooth Sources
This is another nice upgrade for anyone who needs to switch between a smartphone and a computer a lot. You don't have to go in and disconnect from one device in order to connect to the other any more. Just click ""connect"" on the second device and the Nuras switch over.
Other upgrades
There are a few other bits and bobs worth mentioning in the G2 update, like audio prompts that let you know what the battery percentage is doing, and an audible confirmation when you plug them in to charge.
The automatic on/off power setting has been re-jigged; it now pauses whatever music is playing when you take the cans off, but doesn't disconnect for 60 seconds.
Touch button commands now include double-tap functions, which expands the number of things you can program them to do. This solves a problem I had where I kept accidentally bumping the buttons. It happened often enough that I turned off all the button functions. Now, with double taps, that happens far less often. So that's all I use.
And noise canceling tech has been added to voice calls, improving your ability to make calls in noisier environments.
One key thing that has not been fixed
Not once in the dozens of times I've run the Nuras' adaptive hearing test routine have I managed to get ticks on both sides to indicate that I've got a decent seal for a proper test. Every single time I've tried it, with every single person I've shown these to, we've had to ""continue anyway"" and ignore the fact that the headphones felt there wasn't a good enough seal. It doesn't seem to matter too much, they still sound terrific.
The hearing-adaptive otoacoustic equalization routine on the Nuraphones remains unique despite several other adaptive headphone companies springing up since we first saw these things. Having tried some of the others, we'd also rate the Nura approach as far quicker and more impressive, doing everything automagically in about a minute instead of making you take a 15-minute hearing test.
The sheer horsepower, audio fidelity, synaesthetic visual detail and insanely immersive skin-conduction bass boost effect makes Nura still our go-to listening tool when it's time to put music under the microscope. This G2 update is a sweet and unexpected free cherry on the top of a fantastic sundae.
Nuraphones retail for US$399, AU$499, £349 or €399 depending on your region. If you're quick, there's an Amazon Prime Day deal that lets you grab a pair for 25 percent off."

- good sound , but certainly no “oh my god” moment for me
- Build quality good
Cons
- quite uncomfortable after a while and earcups get hot!
-Proprietary charging cable
- I obtained several profiles for my ears- each time obtaining different results!
I updated to the new software before returning- have to say the noise cancelling update did not seem to work too well for me
Overall not a bad price when Amazon doing a deal ,but in the end I went for the Sony WH-1000XM2 headphones and am pleased I did!"

That was me! My Mum's book has slowed down since then, but she sold about 15,000 of her first book. She's followed this up with other ones but it's a total mixed bag. One of her books never sold any and was a complete failure, then it sold 70 copies in one week, then back to zero again, and we never could work out why. The thing I like about self publishing is that it's free to do, so if you have an idea and like writing then there's nothing to lose from self publishing it, as long as you have the skills to make something that makes sense to the reader. There's some absolute guff on Amazon, but if you can write something that people like then why not go for it?"

10. Roberto Firmino (Brazil) v Austria, 18/11/2014
An 83rd-minute winner swerved into the top corner with pace from 25 yards out: (at 2.30)
9. Philippe Coutinho (Brazil) v Mexico, 07/06/2015
Coutinho beats his man, reaches the byline, shapes to pull the ball back, but instead flashes the ball into the net from an impossible angle: (1.15)
8. Gonzalo Higuain (Argentina) v Paraguay, 30/06/2015
Some intricate passing involving Lionel Messi looks like it breaks down as Messi slips, but he still manages to prod the ball through to Higuain, who hooks it into the top corner with tremendous pace: (6.58)
7. Jesus Corona (Mexico) v Venezuela, 14/06/2016
Combining superb footwork and power to waltz through the Venezuelan defence, Corona keeps his head to finish it off as well to salvage a late equaliser:
6. Yerry Mina (Colombia) v Uruguay, 11/10/2016
A brilliant leap and a looping header to match from 15 yards out – one of the best headed goals you’ll see: (2.20)
5. Franko Andrijasevic (Croatia) v Chile, 11/01/2017
A first time cross from the right, and Andrijasevic meets it with a perfect near-post volley: (0.26)
4. Edison Flores (Peru) v Bolivia, 01/09/2017
Some silky footwork out wide and, although the cross is cleared, it is retrieved by Flores who smashes the ball in off the bar from 20 yards: (5:20)
3. Gilbert Alvarez (Bolivia) v Peru, 01/09/2017
A lob that goes seemingly miles in the air before dropping into the net evading the covering defenders: (9.10)
2. Christian Eriksen (Denmark) v Australia, 21/06/2018
A neat lay-off by Jorgensen, and brilliant technique on the shot from Eriksen:
1. Denis Cheryshev (Russia) v Croatia, 07/07/2018
Cheryshev plays a one-two with Dzyuba, before bending a stunning shot around defender and keeper from distance:
And two goalkeeping howlers:
David Ospina (Colombia) v Peru, 11/10/2017
For some reason, Paolo Guerrero shoots directly at goal from an indirect free kick; if Ospina had watched it go into the net, it would of course been disallowed, but instead he attempts to save it, only to push it into the inside of the side netting for an own goal: (4.52)
Hugo Lloris (France) v Croatia, 15/07/2018
Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris enjoyed football’s ultimate glory in lifting the World Cup trophy, but not before embarrassing himself on the biggest stage of all with an extraordinary attempt to dribble around Mario Mandzukic – it was just as well his side were 4-1 up at the time:

Pirated copies of PC games such as Watch Dogs 2 and Grand Theft Auto V were being sold on Flipkart earlier this week. According to complaints from customers on Twitter, the site allowed sellers to list illegal versions of these games. In the case of Watch Dogs 2, a crack could be purchased. For the uninitiated, a crack allows users to bypass the game’s security features, usually to avoid paying for it completely. In this case, purchasing it avoids paying full price. As for GTA V, certain merchants were selling accounts which already have the game registered. Legal copies are sold on disc or via code that’s redeemed via Rockstar Social Club, GTA V’s online service created by series developer Rockstar Games. Selling access to an account to play GTA V is a telltale sign of it usually being acquired through phishing or hacking attempts designed to steal accounts from those who have already bought the game.
For its part, Flipkart claims these products have been removed from its marketplace and has blacklisted these merchants.
“Flipkart is a marketplace which helps sellers connect with customers across the country. We observe a zero tolerance policy on incidents where sellers are found violating rules pertaining to copyright, quality or genuineness of a product, or any other applicable laws of the land. As a responsible marketplace, we have immediately removed the concerned products and blacklisted the seller on our platform,” a spokesperson for the company told Gadgets 360 via email.

At the time of filing this story neither Rockstar Games nor Ubisoft, creators of GTA V and Watch Dogs 2 respectively, have replied to Gadgets 360’s request for comment. Though the latter appears to be aware of the issue. This is because the official Ubisoft customer support Twitter account is soliciting reports from consumers “to pursue it.” This story will be updated if we hear from either company.
This isn’t the first time online stores have run afoul selling pirated games. Back in 2014, Amazon India had listed pirated copies of Watch Dogs 1 for sale on PC. And this hasn’t been restricted to video games either. Merchandise such as apparel and toys for the Pokemon series has also been the target of less than scrupulous sellers in the past.
“[In India] 95 to 98 percent of the market is unorganised. Most opportunistic retailers know that if something is hot, they bring things in,” said Jiggy George, Founder and CEO of Dream Theatre, which is The Pokemon Company’s agency in India to Gadgets 360 in an interview.

Anyone who has purchased, please give some recommendation. Bluetooth sucks I think. Mainly because you need to be in fair range of it.

This post helps you find ways to cut budget to save money! We help you get the most out of your travel dollars, with our 10 best tips to do Walt Disney World on a budget. ( Last updated July 22, 2018 .)
Regardless of your budget, it’s never a bad idea to consider ways to save more money. For some of you, cutting spending may be the only way you can afford a trip to Walt Disney World. For others, saving money might not be strictly necessary, but rather is a way to fund a slightly longer trip…or a second Disney trip.
We have been in both positions (I still vividly remember the days or ordering an extra bun so we could “split” a double cheeseburger at Cosmic Ray’s) and while we are able to splurge more now, we still pay careful attention to our spending and make every effort to get the most bang for our buck. After all, those wasted dollars could be the makings of another trip!
Here are some of our recommendations for saving money on your 2018 Walt Disney World vacation. Not all of these things will be for everyone. We each value different aspects of our trips differently, and what is unnecessary for some might be make or break for someone else. These are just possible ideas, not across the board recommendations for everyone. Cost-cutting is not a good idea when it’s at the expense of the fundamental experience–if you cut things that are important to you, don’t be surprised if the amount of fun you have is negatively impacted.
We’ve arranged this list so that the best options are at the top (meaning #10 should save you the most money, and #1 the least), but there’s obviously a ‘your mileage may vary’ element. For example, if you’re basically a Coca-Cola guzzling polar bear, maybe #2 would save you more than #9! (Then again, you can use #9 to get your Coke fix, so maybe not.) Anyway, we’re getting ahead of ourselves–here’s the list… 10. Never Pay Full Price for Hotels
For most people, hotels are the single most expensive component World. If you plan on staying in a Deluxe Resort, your hotel could eat up more than half of your entire vacation budget. While we love the Deluxe Resorts, we hate their pricing, and (frankly) think they are not worth their rack rates. We have four alternatives to paying full price for Deluxe Resorts, with the best option last, so you have plenty of options if you “need” posh accommodations.
First, consider “downgrading” to a Moderate Resort, namely Port Orleans Riverside . This resort is basically a “Deluxe Minus” resort hotel, with beautiful grounds, nice amenities, and top notch theme and detail. With that said, it’s definitely not in the same league as Deluxes. The rooms are smaller and not as well appointed, and there are other little details that are lacking. Still, we love Riverside.
Second, book a stay at the third-party Swan & Dolphin instead. You might equate “third-party” with off-site, but that’s not the case here, as these are within walking distance of Epcot. As we discuss in our Swan & Dolphin Review , these hotels are incredibly nice, just lacking in “Disney” theme. Yes, they have a bunch of annoying fees, but the net price is still significantly less expensive than the nearby Boardwalk Inn or Yacht & Beach Clubs.
Third, plan your visit during Free Dining and book a Deluxe. We have a huge post about the Free Disney Dining Plan promotion , including historical dates, how much money it can potentially save . We even offer email subscribers free alerts about Free Dining . You’ll pay full price for your hotel, which is tough to swallow, but the savings in food definitely helps offset that.
Saving the absolute best for last is renting Disney Vacation Club (or DVC) Points ( click here to book with the cheapest point DVC rental company ). If you want to know more, we cover the exact steps for doing this, and why we recommend it, in our Tips for Renting Disney Vacation Club Points post, which offers a great way to stay in Deluxe-caliber on-property rooms for significant savings.
That last one is truly the best of both worlds, and might seem too good to be true, but we promise it’s 100% real and legit. We are Disney Vacation Club owners, and even we sometimes rent points (when we don’t have enough). 9. Grocery Delivery
Basically, for a small delivery fee, these stores will deliver groceries you order (you choose from a limited menu of what they offer at price points they set). It’s more expensive than going out and shopping yourself, but it’s cheaper than buying groceries from Disney gift shops. Plus, you save time (and potentially the cost of a rental car) by having the groceries delivered.
We have used Garden Grocer with great success , but there are other options, as well. We cover all of the ways to get groceries in our Tips for Buying Groceries post. If you don’t want to use a grocery delivery service or visit a store, and just need smaller snack, another option is mailing yourself an Amazon package ( details here ).
The one-two punch of renting Disney Vacation Club points and doing grocery delivery can pretty easily cut the cost of in half. (If not save you even more!) 8. Use Credit Cards
This one could rank higher, but we recognize it’s not for everyone, and also comes with an opportunity cost (if you use the points , you can’t use them elsewhere). Nonetheless, we think leveraging credit card rewards can be a great way of getting “free” airfare or hotel rooms…or just paying for some meals.
Many proponents of saving money are opponents of credit cards. This is ludicrous. I will acknowledge that others have dramatically different views when it comes to credit cards, but we view them as glorious tools that, like water balloon launchers , have the potential for humans to abuse and misuse.
We have earned tens of thousands of dollars in rewards on credit cards, without ever paying a cent of interest (although we have paid annual fees on certain cards). We cover which credit cards we recommend using to save money on travel in our Best Credit Cards for Disney Travel post.
Beyond travel-specific credit cards, getting a good “everyday” credit card for daily purchases can be a great way to earn money that you can earmark for vacations. This gives a different meaning to “saving” money, but it’s an idea nonetheless. Rather than using the Disney Chase Visa credit cards that are popular with many Disney fans, we recommend cards like the Chase Freedom Rewards or AMEX Blue Cash (the AMEX has an annual fee, but if you spend enough, better reward rates can easily compensate for an annual fee) for everyday use.
These cards have better reward rates, and you can allocate their cash back to your vacation account, or use the rewards for airfare or other components of a Walt Disney World vacation. Just because rewards aren’t in the form of a Disney gift card doesn’t mean that you can’t save them for Disney. Hate credit cards if you want, but there’s no arguing that paying your balance off in full each month and using credit cards responsibly can save you money. 7. Gift Card Hacks
This is one we learned about a few years ago and we’ve been utilizing since. There are a few different methods for saving money on Disney gift cards, and we cover all of the methods in our Tips for Saving Money on Disney Gift Cards post. Unfortunately, the best ‘hack’ of stacking Raise.com plus a Target Red Card to save ~10% has been closed as of July 2018, but you can still save around 5%, which is not too shabby!
You can save money at Kroger, Sam’s Club, and other stores just by making strategic Disney gift card purchases. These strategies undoubtedly work with other credit cards, too. We have cards with rotating 5% back categories and other time-limited incentives. 6. Skip the Disney Dining Plan
Whether the Disney Dining Plan is worth the money is an age old debate (well, at least as old as the Dining Plan is). If saving money is your primary concern, it’s very difficult to argue in favor of the Disney Dining Plan . Yes, you absolutely can (still!) save money on the Disney Dining Plan, but that assumes a certain type of vacation style. Namely, one focused on eating steaks or other expensive entrees and eating a lot of food, or taking home snacks so as to not waste snack credits.
Few people “need” as much food as the Disney Dining Plan offers, and certainly no one “needs” to eat steak for every meal. (Although this might be a cool medical condition I wouldn’t mind having!) If saving money is a priority, you can eat far more economical meals off the Disney Dining Plan than on it.
If you’re looking to save money, the question to ask here is “how little could we spend on food and still have a good trip?” and compare that number to the cost of the Disney Dining Plan, not “how much would the same amount of food we’d get on the Disney Dining Plan cost if we paid for it out of pocket?” 5. Skip the Park Hopper
As much as it pains me to say this since I love Park Hopping, but if you’re on a budget, it might be wise to skip it–depending upon what park ticket discounts are available when you book. It’s tempting to upgrade to the Park Hopper tickets because they usually aren’t that much more, but if you aren’t going to Park Hop much, it’s still a waste. Plus, for your family, the “small” cost of Park Hoppers does add up quickly, and you might be able to save $250 or more simply by skipping the Park Hopper option.
Determine whether this is something you need or can drop in our Tips for Saving Money on Walt Disney World Tickets post. If we were not Annual Passholders, Park Hopping is not something we could live without, but your mileage may vary on that. We like to stay in the park that is open latest, and that usually means hopping to that park towards the end of the day. For us, it would unquestionably be worth the extra cost, even if on a budget, and even if that meant sacrificing something else.
Many guests, especially those with young kids, aren’t staying late at night anyway, and calling it an early night rather than park hopping to the one that’s open latest each night isn’t going to be a big deal to them. If you are on a tight budget, consider how important Park Hopping is to you, and whether you can do without it. 4. Plan a “Free” Day
There’s some duplicity of meaning in “free” day. Here it means both a day where you don’t have the theme parks on your schedule, and also a day when you focus on things that are free. The idea is that you do something that is actually free in practice, not just in theory.
Going shopping at Disney Springs most likely will not be free even though there is no “admission” fee–it could very easily cost more than a day in the park. Do a resort tour ( we’re partial to this one around Christmas! ), go swimming in your hotel’s pool, or go for a walk around the resort. We actually have 1-Day “No Parks” Walt Disney World Itinerary that provides a plan of how you can enjoy a great day outside of the parks.
If you can’t do an entire day, the upside to this is that it doesn’t need to be the entire day. You can have it be the morning before a hard ticket event (if you feel these events are worth doing in light of your budget) so you don’t have to use a park ticket.
Even if you do have to use a park ticket, if you can stay out of the park for more than half a day, chances are that you’re going to save some money by buying fewer snacks, cheaper meals, etc. On long vacations, we are fans of the free day for recharging your energy for the rest of the trip, so even though this might not be a source of great savings (and we’ll be frank–it’s probably not), we still recommend it. 3. Skip Souvenirs
“Collect moments, not things.” This has become a mantra we’ve adopted over the last few years as we’ve prioritized great experiences over stuff. Mind you, we still buy souvenirs and a fair amount of things, but we’ve gotten rid of a lot of our junk, and buy far fewer souvenirs these days.
If this is a tough sell with your family, look at it this way: how many extra experiences or days in the parks could that souvenir budget buy you? The memories will last a lifetime, that Mickey Mouse bobblehead someone just had to have will wind up in the garage sale or on eBay in a few years.
An alternative to this is advance-purchasing souvenirs when they’re on sale on Amazon or at the DisneyStore. Pre-purchasing Disney Pins is also popular, albeit controversial ( details here ). 2. Say No to Soda
Large drinks are over $3 a pop (no pun intended–used in the colloquial sense, as I don’t want to start a pop v. soda v. coke debate!). If you’re soda-addicted, you could be spending $10 or more per day on soda. I speak from first-hand experience, and I’ll be the first to admit I’m guilty of this. In looking over receipts from a recent trip, I was shocked at how much I had wasted on soda.
This is something I’m personally planning to correct this year (update: I haven’t purchased a single soda in 2018 or Disneyland thus far!). If you need the caffeine, get your fill of coffee in the morning from your hotel room or get your fix at a restaurant offering free refills. 1. Order “Entree-Only” Instead of Combo Meals
Typically, the menu price listed at a Disney counter service restaurant is a “combo” price, including fries or some other side. The cost of these sides is around $1.50 to $2.00, which is included in the price on the menu, but deducted from the price guests pay if they order the entree only (a price that is normally, conveniently left off of the menu).
Many guests don’t even know that they have the option of ordering without fries or chips, and end up buying something they don’t need, simply because the way the menus are presented. As is the case with our skip the Disney Dining Plan advice: don’t order what you don’t want to eat. (Note: some Cast Members also don’t know this option exists, so you may experience inconsistent results trying this at the cash register.)
Of course, there are plenty of other ways to save money on , and what works for one party may not work for others. How much you can save all depends upon which compromises you’re willing to make, and what parts of the Disney experience are really important to you. Some people may be able to save a lot, others may find that none of these tips will work for them (others still might already be doing all of these things!). Hopefully, there’s at least an idea or two here that’s helpful to you!

Unfortunately I lost them after a visit to the pub and upon trying to order another pair; Amazon mentioned there was a later model available which brought me here.
First thing I noticed when the headphones arrived was how light the box was when it was delivered. Before I opened it up I was convinced they had sent me the wrong item. To my surprise the box contained all the support gear and the headphones.
They arrived partially charged so after making sure my managers weren’t around I easily linked them to my phone via Bluetooth and stuck some Nirvana on. For a cheap set of headphones I was really surprised by the quality of sound and the level of comfort. You could pay twice the price for another set of headphones and not have the quality of these headphones.
I wouldn’t say these can compete with the top of the line headphones but I got them to cope with the rough and tumble of the daily commute and to take in the pool at the gym. They perform this function admirably.
My only criticism comes with the support gear and the design. It’s a bit too cheap. The lovely hard case that was provided with the MPOW Flame has been replaced with what I can only describe as a plastic bag that I wouldn’t even put my spare change in. Good thing I kept my MPOW Flame case but with these headphones as cheap as they are I’m happy to just chuck them in my gym bag or keep in my jacket.
Additionally, a nicer USB wire could have been supplied to give a more premium experience. The one provided looks exactly like every other one you ever got with an electronic device. Some individuality here would go long way in helping MPOW to develop its brand.
In terms of design, in my opinion they do look cool. I feel like I have a terminator/predator style targeting device mounted on my ear which I appreciate. The buttons for altering the volume and skipping tracks are located on the right head set. However, the buttons are made of the same plastic as the body which can make changing the volume or track a bit of a fumble if you have calluses from years of playing guitar. Additionally, the volume control is the wrong way round. The volume up should be at the front with the volume down at the back.
If you were to plonk these down on a picnic table at the pub they’re not going to gain any admirers and if you tell anyone how much they cost they will probably say ‘that makes sense’ until they hear the sound they produce. But all in all these are fantastic headphones if you care about sound and quality over branding and chauvinism.​"

Seven dollar bacon strips anyone?
The city's newly-opened Avery restaurant isn't any different in that sense. The prix-fixe East Asian-infused eatery takes reservations through Tock , the high-dollar restaurant equivalent of OpenTable that allows guests to reserve and pay for meals beforehand. No post-meal payment needed.
The restaurant is currently offering three menus: Cello Player, a smaller course plan for $89 a person, Avery's Room, a reservation for six to eight people featuring a special menu from the kitchen, and the seafood-themed Bouquet of the Sea for $189 a pop.
I took a gander at the latter during a recent visit to Avery and concluded that when it comes to eating in this city, you get what you pay for — which in this case is 10 meticulously-crafted, delicious dishes for $189 a person.
Now Playing: The San Francisco Chronicle's food critic Michael Bauer talks about eating caviar off of the back of his hand at the SF restaurant Avery, which he recently reviewed for the Chronicle.

The entry way features a black slatted wall. We were seated behind it, in a cozy booth.

Tips to save up easily,My message to business school students that have recently graduated,2018-07-22T19:22:00.000+03:00,blogs,US,,Benedetta,"Scroll Down
You all probably have diverse reasons to have selected to study business and finance, a family business to go run, the ambition to become CFO of a large corporation, the choice of working in financial services, or maybe watching too much of Gordon Gekko on Wall street….
My reason to choose to study business was simple. When I was a young child, I would often go by my father’s office to visit and he would let me sit at his desk, on a revolving office chair. I was in LOVE, and all my childhood dreams of being an astronaut or a marine biologist were swiped away that second. I wanted to be sitting in an office, on a revolving chair, playing with this “instrument” that had a funny keyboard as the letters were not alphabetically ordered.
My father is an entrepreneur and at the time I had no idea of what it meant but I can probably start thinking that that day in his office, was more influential than I could have ever thought considering who I have become today.
From my father’s time, things have changed dramatically. University then was for a small few and immediately brought to a job at a large corporation. The possible paths one could choose were very clear and very few, and year over year your career would progress linearly at the same company until retirement. Graduate woman were only 30% of the total graduates, and very few reached corporate leadership.
Today things have changed, many of you could be the first in your family to achieve a degree and masters, and for that a huge congratulations. I also see so many more women who have decided to study and enter the finance world. With more access, though comes more competition and the labor market is not as “rosy” as it used to be. Entering the job market and navigating it probably feels like a bigger challenge, but I actually think you are at the forefront of a new industrial revolution that will redefine jobs and skills.
Marc Andreessen, one of the leading venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, famously said; “The spread of computers and the internet will put jobs in two categories: people who tell computers what to do, and people who are told by computers what to do.”
At this point, you there are three choices you can take. You can ignore the changes that are happening and let them pass by; you can select to hinder the innovation and fight it but eventually you will realize that you might delay its effects but it will prevail. Or you can chose to embrace it, and transform your career thanks to the disruption happening, or actually become the frontrunner of this change.
The World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report estimates that 65% of children entering primary schools today will ultimately work in new job types and functions that currently don’t yet exist. What does this mean?
Even though you have had the best of education, the time-spent learning will continue to increase; you probably want to get the hell away from books for a while, (and I would understand), but I can promise you that you will need to be constantly challenging yourself to new knowledge to strive in your careers. They great thing is that the skills that will be valued the most over the next 5–10 years are Complex Problem Solving and Creativity, something that we Italians are good at and that hopefully we have managed to transmit to you all.
What I hope for you all is that you uses these abilities and find your roles. You are still the privileged ones, the ones that can truly take on the world’s problems and go find solutions in a way that gives back to communities or society as a whole.
Today the Gordon Gekko corporate greed, has been replaced by leaders with deeper missions. When Sergey Brin and Larry Page founded Google in their garage they chose ‘Don’t be Evil’ as the corporate motto and Googlers generally apply those words to how they serve users. Mark Zuckerberg, in his famous IPO letter starts by reminding investors; “Facebook was not originally created to be a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission — to make the world more open and connected.”
Also, it has never been easier to start something, build your own startup and shape your own future. My father, built a software company in the 1980s, when the capital needed was significant and the product was actually a disk that had to be sold from company to company with a physical sales team. Today, the internet, cloud computing and remote web services (like Amazon Web services) allows people to start companies with less than probably what you will spend on your graduation lunch.
We started Oval in February with 200€. I spent 30€ to open a company in the UK, and the rest for three flights return to London where my co-founders and I went to open a bank account. We realized that the so-called ‘fintech’ market was rapidly building new products that would slowly replace the dominance of banks and insurance companies. We wanted to do more; our mission is that of using technology to tailor financial education to every individual and personalize the steps that make a person, financially healthy, and thus included in the financial market, with access to transparent products. In the UK, a developed market and a financial center hub, an OECD study found that just about 50% of the interviewed pass the financial literacy threshold and that the youngest have a lower literacy that the over 40s.
We decided to tackle this huge problem, by building an app that can replace the branch financial advisor. Oval is built as an online community. We enable people to gain financial knowledge while connecting to each other with the help of a smartphone app. With Oval, setting money aside will become easier, and tracked simply, through analytics and personalization that empower and motivate to be money wise.
Oval provides easy to read, readily available information on everyday expenses. By connecting with any bank account or card, Oval can aggregate, categorize and simplify the user-unfriendly confusing information from bank statements. Given every great achievement starts from a beginning, Oval allows users to set a number of steps, personalized pledges that automatically assigns a micro transaction to a spending or behavioral habit. Every week the app automatically uses the steps and creates a saving balance that will be moved weekly into a personal, 100% guaranteed and secure digital wallet. The savings accumulated in the wallet will be available to users to withdraw at anytime, but keeping them away will open a whole set of possible solutions to enrich the financial profile of the users.
In the last 15 years Edleman has built the Trust Barometer Index, a tool used to analyze the level of trust people have in different sectors. In 2015, with over 33,000 interviews across 27 countries, the trust index on financial services remains the lowest of all industries. Actually the only product that has gained a significantly higher score, is technology driven finance products like electronic payments. But people do not change their bank account, it is actually estimated that the probability of you divorcing is higher than that of you switching to a new bank.
I believe this will change, thanks to the huge impact that new business models have had on other sectors, which are still nascent in the financial services market. Before starting Oval, I worked for 3 years in Uber, leading its operations on the Italian market. I was called for an interview when I was living in Asia, and in the beginning unsure if going back to Italy. But the company and the mission inspired me, and remember that at the time it was still a small startup with no operations outside the US. The idea that transport, should become as easy and reliable as running water was a mission I was willing to embrace. Also, I had lived enough years abroad to forget how the taxi market in Italy worked and naively thought it would be a smooth ride…
Launching the app in Milan and then expanding across Italy was an incredible experience, and being the second country in Europe to adopt the peer-to-peer solution Uber POP became a marvelous challenge. This is because as Uber became bigger, it managed not only to shift the rules on transport, but it was at the forefront of the fourth industrial revolution, towards a new future for flexible and empowered employment.
The WEF report in fact outlines that today the number one driver of change for future employment is flexible work, with 44% of respondents assigning it as the number one trend. On the technological drivers of change, mobile Internet emerges as the most popular between respondents, and sharing economy and crowdsourcing appears to be the top trend for 12% of respondents.
Collaborative platforms and flexible work emerged because of one major factor; the introduction of a trust score online! This became the one single element that allowed the likes of Uber, Airbnb and BlaBlaCar to rise.
In fact Edelman Study also shows that of the people interviewed, 75% will consult their community, before making a decision, thus building trust. This has helped the emergence of new business models also in financial services world. In fact, crowdfunding has expanded to over 2000 platforms globally and expected to reach 10% of the market share by 2020; the emergence of blockchain technologies and bitcoin have enabled a truly peer to peer payment networks that do not use the banking circuits; peer to peer is also changing the insurance industry with higher transparency and a redistribution of unused payments to benefit the end user.
I could go on forever about the changing landscape and probably as I speak today, something new is being built in some corner of the world. As technology becomes more of a commodity, perseverance, creativity and design thinking will make a difference between the winners and the losers. Chose the problem you want to solve, and do everything that you can to create the most impactful solution. Do this in your own startup or in a bigger corporate, it does not matter where you choose to be.
I know today you may feel like having reached the finishing line, but actually I see today as the beginning of your journey. I therefore wish the best start to you all, whatever you chose it to be!

Here are only two of my visual samples for the interior of their famed Opera House in Manaus. The second view is from one of the two grand boxes that were immediately overlooking the stage for the rich rubber barons who lived here during the peak years of their economy.:
(Open your screen/viewer wider to see these pictures larger/better!)
Here is just one sample from our little ""walk"" in the rainforest 60 miles north of Manaus. Fortunately, no rain for us. But, we would have other challenges. When you walk into the ""jungle"", you get out of the sun and can really feel things not being as hot. BUT, it was still very humid. Christine, our guide from Amazon Ecco Adventure Tours, did an excellent job and was super hard-working as we ""progressed"" along these complicated trails that gave us a taste from being an explorer like Indiana Jones.:
Before going ashore in Manaus on our last day there, this is one of the views while having breakfast. We could see many of the nearby smaller ""commuter"" ships being loaded with goods and people. We were docked right in the ""heart"" for all of the por t ""action""!! :
Visiting t he markets of Manaus, including those that are more for wholesale fish, produce, etc., was bo th fund and in teres ting. Plus, free to do on our own. First shown is a typical local food, take-away style place. The next picture shows some from the fish market that was s timula ting to experience, sample the human interactions, etc.:"

From the CNN news ne twork las t fall, they had this headline: B est things to do in Manaus  with these highlights:  A city of 1.8 million people surrounded by 2 million square miles of Amazon jungle more than 1,500 miles from Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, it doesn't get as many tourists as those two cities. Manaus is a gold mine of brightly colored architecture, riverfront views and world-class eating, minus the huge crowds. At the turn of the 20th century, Manaus was the center of a lucrative global trade in rubber. Today, it's the gateway for thousands of tourists seeking Amazon jungle adventures at the many lodges outside the city. 
For a key attraction we loved in Manaus, this article shared: ""Manaus' Amazonas Theater (aka Teatro Amazonas or simply The Opera House) is an opulent ode to the rubber boom of the 1800s when rubber barons and the local government had more money than they knew what to do with. Some of that windfall was used for the construction of the theater. It took 15 years to complete and includes tiles, stained glass and other elements brought from Europe.""

The excited ended quickly. I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus. Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message. I tried to set this up over and over and over again. I watched YouTube videos. I read set up websites. I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).
The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support. I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error. Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work. This product has tested my patience. So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.
The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb. The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.
I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo? The support person had the same thought. Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub. It looks like a defuser.
I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show the problems I did. Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had. OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already."

So without further ado, here are our winners and losers from this year’s Comic-Con.
Winner: Warner Bros. Pictures — With Marvel Studios absent this year, Warner Bros really stepped up with its Hall H presentation this year. They delivered excellent trailers for “The Lego Movie 2,” Godzilla: King of the Monsters” and the new “Fantastic Beasts,” and treated fans to the DC Comics version of the normal Marvel presentation with awesome footage from “Wonder Woman 1984” and “Aquaman” that was exclusive to Hall H and had everyone buzzing all day Saturday.
Loser: Johnny Depp — Depp shocked everyone in Hall H when he appeared on stage in character as Grindlewald, but he quickly left the room in stunned silence as he mumbled haltingly through his lines.
 Winner: 20th Century Fox — “The Predator” opened Comic-Con with a bang on Thursday, and Fox ably stepped into the normal Marvel Studios slot on Saturday night with a really fun and funny “Deadpool 2” panel.
Winner: “Amazon Prime Video” — They basically took over Comic-Con this year, with the craziest fan activation we’ve ever seen, ads that were everywhere, and a “Man in the High Castle” panel that was immaculate in how it managed to provide fans with just enough compelling details for its third season without going overboard.
Loser: Marvel — Marvel Studios didn’t even have a presence at Comic-Con this year, and yet they had still managed to produce the biggest bummer story of the weekend with the firing of “Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn. Gunn’s tweets are certainly indefensible, but the fact that Disney cowered to a smear campaign drive by disingenuous right-wingers is a whole other discussion.
Winner: “Demolition Man” — Being a cult classic approaching its 25th anniversary, there was not really any reason to expect the Wesley Snips/Sylester Stallone flick to steal the show during Comic-Con. And yet it managed to do just that with afuturistic Taco Bell pop-up restaurant that was the talk of the show Thursday evening.
Winner: “Venom” — This movie has been thought of pretty much as a joke since the start, but Sony’s panel and footage presentation in Hall H could be the start of its rehabilitation ahead of its release in October. That panel left a lot of folks feeling good about this movie for the first time.
Loser: “Titans” — So DC’s first live-action TV series for its DC Universe streaming service was trending all day Thursday for all the wrong reasons. The first teaser trailer for the show was just so dopey and hilarious.
Winner: CW superheroes — The CW dominated Ballroom 20 with a four-hour block of panels for “Supergirl,” “Arrow,” “Legends of Tomorrow” and “The Flash,” and came out swinging hard. But most notable among the announced new cast and characters was the groundbreaking casting of trans actress Nicole Maines as the first transgender superhero, Dreamer.
Winner/Loser: “Star Wars” — Lucasfilm managed to bring something to Comic-Con that people actually cared about (the “Clone Wars” revival) for the first time in years. But also the presence of fans rocking “Star Wars” gear was pretty low for a Comic-Con taking place just two months after a new “Star Wars” film.
Loser: “The Walking Dead” — Not AMC’s fault by any means, but the Hall H panels for “The Walking Dead” and “Fear the Walking Dead” took place just after James Gunn was fired off “Guardians of the Galaxy” on Friday. That whole thing completely drowned out anything and everything in its path, so the business-as-usual panels
Winner: “Iron Fist” — The first season was easily the worst of Marvel’s Netflix shows, but if the many clips we saw at the show’s panel in Ballroom 20 are any indication of season 2’s quality, folks could be in for a delightful surprise when it drops.
Loser: Donald Trump — Last year’s edition of Comic-Con managed to be almost entirely apolitical, but that wasn’t the case this time. Some attendees in anti-Trump cosplay drew tons of attention around the con, and we got some big moments during panels of stars expressing anti-Trump sentiments, like when Zoe Kravitz said that if she had magic in real life she’d use it to impeach Trump.

Eileen Delehanty Pearkes has been researching and writing about the history and politics of water in the upper Columbia Basin since 2005.
Her book on the Columbia River Treaty, A River Captured , which can be purchased on Amazon was released in 2016. Recently, her travelling exhibit on the Columbia River Treaty, curated for Touchstones Nelson, won a national award from the Canadian Museum Association.
Pearkes has agreed to assist The Nelson Daily readers to understand the importance of the Columbia River Treaty to the region with another edition of River Talk. Summer has arrived, with visitors coming from near and far to enjoy the best the upper Columbia River basin has to offer: camping, boating, fishing, arts & culture – this place really shines at this time of year.
Some unique tourists are arriving at the end of July, in part to discuss the abundant water stored by British Columbia under the Columbia River Treaty (CRT). For several years, politicians, academics and policy makers have been positioning themselves from various perspectives to have an influence on the treaty negotiations that are now underway. On July 22, the Pacific Northwest Economic Region foundation kicked off its annual summit in Spokane, Washington, with a focus on the treaty. Learn more here.
Both of the lead treaty negotiators will be there to give brief, carefully scripted updates: Jill Smail, Columbia River Treaty Negotiator, Office of Canadian Affairs, US State Department, and Sylvain Fabi, Executive Director, U.S. Transboundary Affairs, Global Affairs Canada. After that, a roundtable listening session and discussions about “livelihood” and the CRT will fill the day. Here is the agenda .
The following day, participants will tour Grand Coulee Dam. On July 25-26 they will participate in a two-day study tour of the Arrow Lakes Reservoir.
Formed in 1991, the PNWER is a public/private non-profit with a mission to “increase the economic well-being and quality of life for all citizens while maintaining and enhancing our natural environment” in its self-defined region: from Alaska to Idaho, Saskatchewan to Oregon. From what I can tell by surveying the website and the players involved, this is an organization that focuses on how the natural environment can serve the economic interests of businesses engaged in industrial use of resources. These players are invested in a model of Columbia River operations that has, for over 50 years, depended on Canadian storage reservoirs.
I welcome and salute the input and influence of this organization’s stated mission, and would humbly suggest that we have a long way to go to make enough changes to the 1964 Columbia River Treaty that it might begin to enhance “our natural environment.” With 15 dams on the main stem of the international river, imperiled salmon runs; fish blocked from 40% of their viable spawning habitat (much of it in Canada); shoreline ecosystems, wetlands and fisheries in Canada’s storage reservoirs largely destroyed, etc., the CRT has long been involved directly in harmful impacts to the river’s “natural environment.”
It is good that the PNWER’s visit to the Arrow Reservoir in July will involve direct meetings with a few people who really understand and have lived the ecological losses of the Canadian portion of the basin.
Participants will speak to Wally Penner, whose family had to sell a farm in Renata north of Castlegar when the community was flooded and who has been instrumental in creating a more thoughtful approach to hydro-power operations through the Columbia Power Corporation; Janet Spicer, whose father’s rich and productive vegetable farm was also covered by the reservoir, though she continues bravely to farm on a much-reduced parcel of land; and Nakusp Mayor Karen Hammling, who lives daily with the shifting shoreline of her community. All are passionate advocates for keeping alive the memory of the valley before it was flooded, and for redressing some of the ecological and economic losses born by this corner of B.C.
Too bad the fish can’t have a voice, too.
The desire of upper Columbia residents to redress losses faces a powerful set of interests south of the border. A recent New York Times article referenced to the powerful agricultural industry in the mid-basin, one that benefits from the reliable Columbia River flows fed by Canadian storage. Agricultureis a $10.6 billion industry there, and the state leads the nation in producing crops like apples, hops and blueberries.
Irony of ironies. A fertile agricultural valley in Canada lost in 1964 to agricultural interests elsewhere. If you’d like to weigh in on how you feel about the upcoming negotiations, contact MPs Wayne Stetski and Richard Cannings , or MLA and Minister Katrine Conroy . All three will be part of a legislative panel at the PNWER. Let your voices be heard.
This debate about our water is once-in-a-lifetime."

Hi, thank you for reaching DJI Forum. We do apologize for any troubles. Sad to say the mobile device Pixel XL is not fully compatible to run the app. It maybe worked before but some of the features may not be available for the current device after the update. Please take a quick look on some of the fully compatible devices below. Thank you.

Let me add, when you say it might have worked before the update? I have not even updated. I have downloaded 4.2.21 from the play store, run it for a flight, charged battery come back and I get the crash.. Guess I will be sending this back to Amazon since DJI is not interested that 50% of the reviews on the play store are 1* reviews, mainly about crashing/video quality.."

So I am going back to a low cut shoe. These were worn once to try them out but they just would not work. So I removed them and put on my other shoes. So they still look new. I work in an office. These sell on Amazon for $109.95 and they have very few of these shoes left. I did not keep the box so I will let them go for half that price at only $50. That's a firm price. Anything less and I will keep em. Not a thing wrong with them except I can't wear them for work. But I can wear around house so I am not strapped to sell. $40 is an excellent price for these boots.

Say Hello to the FlixBus,2018-07-22T23:28:00.000+03:00,blogs,US,,CityFella,"Sacramento to LA for $15 bucks? Say Hello to the FlixBus Posted on by CityFella Bus Wars?
A few years ago an Bus alternative to Greyhound entered the Sacramento market, Megabus with fares as low as $1.00 to Reno and San Francisco. The San Francisco leg is extremely popular. Giving Sacramentians a lower cost option for communters to the city. Last January, the company discontinued its Reno-Sparks route.
A new player is entering the market. German-based bus carrier FlixBus announced new destinations in California on Thursday, including Sacramento, San Francisco, Bakersfield, Oakland and San Jose.
Trips from Sacramento to Los Angeles are as low as $14.99. Some are $19.99. Trips the other way are at $19.99. Trips to San Francisco are just $4.99. They offer a route from L.A to Vegas for $7.00. Unlike,Megabus Flexbus will offer snacks on some of it’s routes.
Update: Fares for Thursday and Friday are closer to $40.
FlixBus, which began in Germany, expanded to the United States in May of this year and plans to a major player in Transpotation in United States. They plan to open in Stockton, Modesto, Merced Fresno.and Reno.
Buses are coming back, But think Amazon. No brick and morter stations. Booking and paying online. Book in advance and save? There prices are much lower on average than Greyhound and considerabley lower than the train. They offer Free WiFi and charging stations. Millennials seem to be the primary customer base .
The buses will be a true low cost alterative to the airlines. Megabus makes one stop between the Bay Area and Los Angeles. Traveltime between Northern Cailfornia and Southern Cailfornia will be six to seven hours compared to a one hour flight. However once you factor, arrival time, security, travel time to the central city. (if your renting a car at LAX add an additional hour) the time difference is four hours. I’ve expericed the MegaBus and loved it From New Orleans to Austin Texas"

A favorite liberal tactic. Take two pieces of data and claim one had to cause the other. This could be true or the two could be totally unrelated.
In this case it's much more complex than that. There are huge number of factors that distribute the wealth that are totally unrelated to unions. The economy is changing. You have things like Amazon that heavily impact the retail sector. Lots of jobs gone there. Have they been anywhere close to replaced at a equal value? That's a good question. When you change the way you calculate unemployment the number may look better however the employment situation can be worse. Add able body working people to welfare programs you add to poverty. An example of that would be what I witnessed while at a Rockets game one night. I was with my wife's boss who makes a real good salary. Probably in the top several percent. He was paralyzed in a motorcycle accident. At the game he strikes up a conversation with the guy next two him who also is in a wheel chair. Thea guy tells him how hard it is to make it. How he can't do anything or he will lose his disability. He says is about $35K a year. My wife's boss tells him he would be better getting out and excelling. He can't understand that concept.
Point is comparing two data points in a complex situation is usually is pretty useless. You could show that their has been a increase in wind turbines and a increase in global warming. So wind turbines increase global warming. Nobody would believe that because the situation is pretty simple to understand.
We have both union and no-union working for us. It's fact that the non-union guys make the same or higher salary.
What do you think has caused the middle class share of income to decline?
Do the non union guys get as much or more because of the wages paid to the union guys and to keep them from forming or joining a union?"

Anyone here have any opinions about the book ""Why Am I Still Depressed? Recognizing and Managing the Ups and Downs of Bipolar II and Soft Bipolar Disorder"" or its author, Dr James Phelps?
I'm sort of between DXes...well not really since a soft BP spectrum dx isn't really a thing per the DSM to my understanding..and that per DSM rules, I'm still firmly MDD.
The content of the book makes sense to me, thus far. Personally it seems that I fit the soft bipolar disorder criteria almost completely. Is there any validity to the concepts he provides in this book? This is also the guy behind psycheducation.org.
What about the author himself? His qualifications sound valid enough. Or is this one of those guys that see bipolarity in everything..like when you're a hammer, everything is a nail? He does address that possible notion of him being someone who sees BP in everything through logical facts, or at least presented as logical...though honestly it's not like he's going to maintain a site and write books while admitting to being potentially full of shit.
The book: https://www.amazon.com/Depressed-Recognizing-Managing-Bipolar-Disorder/dp/0071462376

We recalled the nights of panic and triumph caring for dozens of critically ill patients, about the day - OK, days - we fell asleep standing up, about the weeks subsisting on saltine crackers and ginger ale.
The conversation turned to a legendary co-resident: He made diagnoses others hadn't even heard of. He rushed patients to lifesaving procedures at the faintest clinical change. He cajoled specialists to see his patients in the middle of the night.
We estimated he'd tallied more years of life saved than anyone else in our program - far beyond what other doctors could have mustered in the same position. He excelled in the medical equivalent of baseball's ""wins above replacement"": the number of victories that a player helps achieve beyond what would be expected from a substitute.
This is, I think, much of what patients want to know when choosing a doctor: Will my diabetes, heart condition or hip replacement be better managed with this doctor or that one? It's also what insurers and governments have tried to measure and incentivize through legions of quality metrics.

Denmark’s Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s top anti-trust regulator is our guest on Global Conversation. What has changed since you ordered that Amazon and Apple should repay huge amounts of money in back taxes to Ireland or Luxembourg? Have you seen any change in their tax policies? I don’t think that you see change that fast. What’s happening is that they are having good progress in collecting the Amazon unpaid taxes and with the Irish we’ve had to ask the European Court to look into it, because the Irish should collect the unpaid taxes as well because now it’s already done in the Netherlands, in Belgium, in Luxembourg, and I think that’s a good thing. But if we see the recent scandals such as the Paradise Papers, isn’t this proof that the EU is quite powerless against the tax avoidance structures widely used by multinationals and also by some member states? The fact that we have these leaks and now we have many, luxleaks, the Swiss leaks, the Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers, I think it shows that things are changing, that the secrets are coming out. It’s leaked everywhere. And this allows us to do something about it. I can do my bit, but member states can change legislation and implement legislation so that it stops.

For me it’s very simple. Where you make your profits, where you have your customers and you do your business, you should also contribute to the society. Because you can do no business if there are no roads, no digital infrastructure, skilled people, customers, all the things that make a decent society. And of course you should contribute there as well as anyone else. “it makes no difference whether that subsidy is a handout in cash, or special tax treatment that means a company pays less tax than its rivals.

If I’m not wrong, you have three cases. What’s the latest? The first one we have concluded, and ordered Google to pay a 2.4 billion euro fine. That is being taken care of, Google are in the process of implementing what they had to do. We have taken no decision yet, we are monitoring it but we don’t know yet if it works as it should, that remains to be seen. And then of course we continue to investigate the two other cases about how Google has been using the operating system Android to stay dominant in search also when we all go mobile. The last case is about AdSense which is about advertising because basically Google is an advertising company. So, of course it is important to see how they use their “muscle”, do they allow for others to do what they themselves did, compete, innovate, be present in the market and present products to customers? Recently many national authorities opened investigations into how these companies collect and use information and I Quote: the President of the Italian authority who said that “big data is a resource for our economy but it could be a problem especially when big data creates a big market power that can be used to foreclose competition”. Do you share his view? We use to think about money as an asset, but data can be the same asset. Because this is the new kind of currency when we pay, when we use a search machine or another service, another digital service, we pay by giving up our data for them to use to make our profiles, to sell t
Media: Euronews The analogy is attractive but flawed: What constitutes a win in medicine - and who's responsible for it - is often unclear. Patients want longer lives, but they also want healthier lives, care that is more compassionate and more convenient, and judicious use of tests and treatments. Doctors work in teams as just parts of an increasingly complex health system, and they are often less in control of outcomes than we think, especially when treating patients with challenging social circumstances and coexisting medical conditions.
Measurement techniques may grow increasingly sophisticated, but doctors are not ballplayers, and health-care statistics are not as simple as a batting average.
That hasn't stopped public and private payers from using pay-for-performance incentives to try to improve how doctors care for patients. The most notable recent example is Medicare's Value-Based Payment Modifier, or VM, which measures the quality and cost of care and offers bonuses or imposes penalties accordingly. How often were patients readmitted to the hospital? What percent had their cholesterol checked? Did it cost a doctor more or less to care for his or her patients than it cost other doctors to care for theirs? While the VM program ends this year, it's similar to Medicare's next attempt at pay-for-performance, the Merit-based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS.
Research suggests, however, that the VM program had no benefit in improving care or reducing costs, and the program's failure adds to a body of evidence finding that financial incentives generally have not been shown to improve patient outcomes. An extensive effort in Britain to pay doctors to better manage hypertension, for example, found no improvement in blood pressure, strokes or heart attacks - and care for conditions not linked to bonuses may have gotten worse. In the United States, quality measurement places considerable burdens on physician practices, which spend more than 15 hours per doctor per week and $40,000 per doctor per year on such reporting.
Patients pay a price, too.
Financial incentives can encourage doctors to avoid sick or socially disadvantaged patients, who are harder to care for and who may negatively affect their quality ratings. Even within the same health system, doctors who care for more underinsured, minority and non-English-speaking patients have lower rankings. But many payment programs - including VM and MIPS - don't adjust for illness severity or socioeconomic status. So if I'm trying to pad my stats, it makes sense to gerrymander my patient panel into the richest, healthiest, most-educated panel possible.
On a deeper level, it's important to ask what these measures are really measuring. Doctors perform thousands of cognitively complex functions every day, but most payment programs evaluate a handful of basic process measures that say more about the systems they work in than the care they personally provide. Primary-care physicians, for example, manage 400 conditions every year requiring broad diagnostic and treatment expertise, but they may be judged primarily on whether patients get mammograms and flu shots.
The question answered, then, is not whether I'm a good doctor but whether I work in a system organized enough to check boxes. Sometimes they're important boxes, no doubt, but they're boxes nonetheless - and they capture a tiny fraction of what doctors do.
Some measurement, however imperfect, is important to keep doctors honest and patients informed. One step may be to solicit more physician input into the measures they feel most accurately capture the value of their care. Another is to ensure that all measures are carefully adjusted for patients' medical and social complexity.
While doctors are generally skeptical of online reviews, such feedback will almost certainly be part of the solution. Already, more than three-quarters of patients use online reviews to find a new doctor, though concerns persist about their accuracy and representativeness. (They're not always written by the patient receiving care, for example.)
A program at the University of Utah offers a possible path forward. In 2012, the university's health system became the first major academic center to release patient-satisfaction data and unedited comments to the public. Reviews are presented in a consumer-friendly format - similar to Yelp or TripAdvisor. More than two dozen other health systems - including Stanford, the Cleveland Clinic, the University of Pittsburgh and Duke - have followed suit.
Some worry that this approach overemphasizes patient satisfaction and undervalues objective outcomes, but research suggests that good patient experience is often correlated with better quality.
More generally, while hospital- and health-system-level evaluations also have problems, there's some evidence to suggest that measuring quality at the organizational level is more feasible and reliable than it is for individual physicians. It may be more effective for payers to experiment with measurement and payment reforms for health organizations - bundled payments, per capita payments, funding for behavioral health and social support - and allow organizational leaders to review doctor performance internally, which is how some leading health systems already assess and compensate their clinicians.
Despite prolonged and costly attempts, insurers and governments have not been able to accurately measure a doctor's value and won't be able to anytime soon. No currently available measures, for example, would have captured my co-resident's worth as a physician. And yet, every doctor in our program knew of his worth, and every patient he cared for benefited.

I did not really need it but for the price I thought it was a good deal. I especially like the fact that I order the 32 gig at a great price. This is not a bad Kindle Fire but it is not as good as I thought it would be. I purchased the Kindle Fire 6 HD two years ago during the Prime Day sale. And although that one is not bad either, it was only 16 gigs which I found was not enough memory. I also thought the Kindle Fire 6 was too heavy for its size. I kept the Kindle Fire 6 but decided to purchase an iPad Mini 4. I paid a lot of money for the mini but after two years, which is not a long time, it is beginning to slow down and because of that I decided I would try another Kindle Fire. I purchased a Kindle Fire 8 HD. After I received it an opened it up I was satisfied with the weight and size but after 24 hours of use it was beginning to annoy me. I do play games, read and listen (text to speak) books and watch movies but the only satisfactory thing I got out of all those was watching the movies. The text to speech is so quiet it is not worth the effort to use. And the games were so freaking annoying. I downloaded the same games I have on my iPad Mini but on the Kindle Fire 8 my God every time I played I would get a stupid pop up or have to purchase coins or post to Facebook, Twitter or post to a score board. Plus most of the games have an app purchases, coin purchases to play or some other pop-up. The in app purchase is usually a monthly fee. I don’t purchase coins, I don’t do monthly fees, I don’t post to Facebook, Twitter or any messaging board. I don’t do any these on my iPad either. I play games for my own enjoyment and not to share with others. I am quite willing to do a one time purchase to avoid all that but that doesn’t seem to be available. I really wanted to like the Kindle Fire 8 but unfortunately that is not gonna happen. As I mentioned before I still have my Kindle Fire 6 HD which has been sitting in a desk drawer for two years unused, collecting dust. Unfortunately I don’t need another Kindle Fire collecting dust. I am sorry Amazon I will be returning the Fire 8. (FYI I also have a Kindle Paperwhite (unused) and two Amazon Echo Dots.)."

Apple unveiled a trio of new iPhones last September and the smallest of the bunch was the iPhone 8 .Just like its big brother, the iPhone 8 Plus , the iPhone 8 sports a glass back, metal frame, and a fragile screen. This diminutive smartphone is going to need some protection. You may also want to add your own special flourish of style. We’re here to help with a look at of some of the best iPhone 8 cases and covers available.
If you’re upgrading from the iPhone 7 , then the good news is that your old case will fit the new iPhone 8. That also means you can check out our roundup of the best iPhone 7 cases for more ideas. You’ll also want to take a look at the best iPhone accessories . If you’re thinking of going big this year, check out our best iPhone X cases guide. Our top picks
After trying out a lot of different iPhone 8 cases, these three are the ones we wholeheartedly recommend. They all have something to offer that you won’t find elsewhere. Speck Presidio Grip Case ($40)
One of our favorite case lines, the Presidio Grip from Speck , offers style and substance. You get two layers of protection to safeguard against drops from up to 10 feet, a scratch-resistant finish, a raised bezel around the screen, and enhanced grip courtesy of the non-slip ridges. The fit is perfect, the button covers are easy to find and not too stiff, and the ridges also prevent any sliding around on surfaces. This case also looks great and comes in a wide range of contrasting and complementary color combinations. There is even a Glitter version now, if you need some sparkle. Of all the different iPhone 8 cases we’ve tried, this is the protective case we use most often. Buy it now from: Nodus Shell Case ($30)
Leather is a comfortable material to hold and it ages gracefully, but you usually have to go for a wallet case if you want a leather finish. Nodus does offer the Access 2 case, which is a stylish wallet, but there’s also the leather Shell case. You get a magnetic mount with it, emblazoned with the elegant octopus Nodus logo, which you can stick on your car dash or another convenient spot. The shell case is minimal with big openings for port and camera access and subtle button covers. It comes in brown, black, teal, or gray and it looks and feels fantastic. If you just want something stylish and lightweight, and you’re prepared to sacrifice some drop protection, then this is a great case. Buy it now from: RhinoShield Mod Case ($32+)
We thought we had seen everything the world of iPhone cases had to offer, but this modular design from RhinoShield offers something truly different. We’re familiar with the CrashGuard bumper, which offers excellent drop protection up to 11 feet in a minimalist design. The Mod case design allows you to add an optional back plate, different colored rims ($5) or buttons ($3), and a camera attachment ($5) that supports wide angle ($60), super wide ($35), macro ($25), and fish-eye ($25) lens attachments. It’s not perfect — the attachments are tiny and assembly is fiddly — but we love the fact you can customize and the lenses produce some really interesting shots you simply wouldn’t be able to get otherwise. Buy it now from: RhinoShield And the rest
The rest of our list are great alternatives if you don’t fancy one of our top three picks. We’ve tried out many of them, but some made the list after being recommended to us, because we tried out the same case with a different phone and liked it, or based on good customer reviews. Casetify Custom Cases ($40+)
What could be better than a fully customized case for your iPhone 8? With Casetify you can upload one of your favorite photos or images, choose a case style that you like, customize the colors, and have them make you a truly personalized, one-of-a-kind iPhone case. There are loads of different options, so you can get everything from a photo of your family on a clear-backed case with an easy-grip protective bumper, to a monogrammed leather wallet case. Buy it now from: Carved Traveler Case ($24+)
If you like natural wood grain, then you can’t go wrong with a case from Carved. Plain wood starts from $24, but the best Carved cases have beautiful designs inlaid, like the Grand Teton pictured, which costs $39. There are also shell inlay designs and prints from some seriously talented artists. The shell case itself is flexible, black rubber with ridged sections to aid grip, tactile button covers, and accurate cutouts. Buy it now from: Nomad Clear Case ($40)
This classy shell case has a typical dual material construction, with a flexible TPE bumper that absorbs impact shock and a tough, transparent polycarbonate back panel. Where it differs from other shell cases is the inclusion of a vegetable tanned Horween leather patch on the back. This patch gives the case a nice feel in hand and it should develop its own patina as it ages. You also benefit from drop protection up to 6 feet with this iPhone 8 case. Buy it now from: LuMee Duo Marble ($70)
LuMee cases not only protect your phone, but also provide studio-quality lighting. The limited edition marble style case comes in three color variants — Black Marble, Pink Quartz, and White Marble. It includes LED lights located on both the front and the back, which means your photos will always be well lit regardless of whether you’re using the front-facing or rear camera. To keep the lights going, each LuMee case comes with a rechargeable battery and charging cord. With its sleek design and siliconeraisededges, it strikes a perfect balance between trendy and durable. Buy it now from: Amazon LuMee Mikol Carrara White Marble Case ($100)
If it’s opulent style you’re after, then this real marble case from Mikol might catch your eye. We tried out the clean Carrara White marble version, but there are options in green, ruby, black, gold, and more. The vein patterns give each case a genuinely unique finish and the marble has been reinforced with fiberglass to reduce the risk of it chipping or shattering. As attractive as this case is, it doesn’t offer a huge amount of protection and it’s expensive. Large cutouts offer easy access to the buttons and the plastic shell curves round your iPhone 8 just enough to snugly hold it, but there is no raised bezel around the screen. It’s really about style, not drop protection, and to that end, Mikol also offers gold engraving of your name or initials for an extra $25. Buy it now from: Mikol Skech Stark Case ($35)
The idea behind the Skech’s new Stark case is to provide real, solid drop protection in a minimal form factor that doesn’t eclipse your iPhone 8. This case promises drop protection for falls of up to eight feet, making it one of the most protective options out there, but it leaves the sides completely open, has large openings for the port and camera, and has a transparent back so you can see Apple’s design. The protection is focused in the corners and along the top and bottom edges, where you need it most. This case is also slim enough that it doesn’t interfere with wireless charging. It comes in black or clear varieties. Buy it now from: Amazon Noreve Tradition B Leather Case ($72+)
Wallet case fans with a love of leather need look no further because the Noreve Tradition B case will tick all of your boxes. This well-padded case covers your iPhone 8 from every angle, with a thin, minimal shell to hold it in place and a solid cover with a magnetic stud closure. You’ll find a couple of card slots inside along with a larger money pocket. The quality is excellent and you can choose from an impressively wide range of different colors and finishes to get the precise look and texture you want. It obviously adds some bulk, but there are accurate openings to ensure you can access every function of your iPhone 8 without having to undress it. Buy it now from: Noreve Caudabe Veil XT Case ($20)
If you dislike chunky cases, but don’t want to risk going completely without protection, then this super-svelte case from Caudabe might tempt you. It’s only 0.35mm thick, and it sports cutouts for the camera, buttons, and port. It’s slightly translucent, with a textured matte finish that’s designed to enhance grip. While it should prevent scratches on the back or frame, there’s no lip to safeguard the screen, and we wouldn’t expect much in the way of drop protection from something this thin — it’s really for minimalists.It comes in blue, red, black, or a kind of frosted finish. Buy it now from: Amazon Caudabe Caseology Skyfall Series Case ($18)
With a knack for creating cases that combine style and protection well, Caseology has been selling boatloads of cases. This one has a clear TPU shell that shows off the back of the iPhone 8, complete with Apple logo. A durable polycarbonate frame, colored to match your iPhone, surrounds the shell for added protection. The cutouts and button covers are good, but what we most appreciate is the solid drop protection and the raised lips around the screen and camera lens. It’s not the slimmest case around, but we think it’s a good-looking option at a reasonable price. Buy it now from: Mous Limitless Shell Case ($45)
Now is the time to pick up one of these very special Limitless cases, due to a substantial discount taking the cost from $85 down to $50 for the iPhone 8 cover. The clever AiroShock system uses tiny air pockets inside the TPU and polycarbonate blend body to achieve a high level of protection for your phone in the event of a fall. Despite this, it only adds 2.3mm to the thickness of your phone — rugged case benefits, without the rugged case. A strong screen protector is included in the package, and there are five different genuine material looks from which to choose. We love the carbon fiber and the very unusual shell finish, and accessories that attach the hidden magnets inside the Limitless case will arrive next year. Buy it now from: Snakehive Vintage Wallet Collection ($30)
What we love about the Snakehive cases most is the super soft, very strokable Nubuck leather that covers the Vintage Collection. Designed in the United Kingdom and handcrafted in Europe, these are beautifully made, attractively styled, and very practical folio cases with space for three credit cards, while your iPhone 8 clips inside a plastic case. The matte Nubuck ages well with time, and just like all the best leather products, it takes on its own look the more you use it. Available in both two-tone, which we like best, and single colors too. Buy it now from: Incipio Esquire Slim Series Case ($25)
If you’re looking for a slim, stylish case to make your cold glass and metal iPhone 8 more comfortable to handle, and a lot easier to grip, then Incipio has you covered. This case boasts a tough polycarbonate core with a bit of flexibility, wrapped in a cotton chambray fabric that comes in black or gray. There are generous openings for easy access to buttons, ports, and the camera, and this svelte case won’t add much to your iPhone’s profile. Buy it now from: Otterbox Symmetry Series Case ($45)
With some of the most protective cases around, you can rely on Otterbox for solid drop protection, but not all of its cases are chunky. The Symmetry Series offers dual-layer drop protection in a fairly slim package that comes in a wide range of fun finishes and colors, some of them new for the iPhone 8. There’s a slight lip to safeguard that screen, flexible button covers, and framed cutouts that won’t interfere with your camera use or cable access. Buy it now from: Silk Base Grip Case ($12)
For all the butter-fingers out there who struggle to keep a hold on the slippery iPhone, this case from Silk could be the answer. It’s quite a slim case, but the outside is textured to provide “Kung Fu grip”. It is very light, but air pockets in the corners help to guard against minor drops and bumps. There are tactile button covers for power and volume, and accurate openings for everything else. It comes in black, gray, blue, and purple. Buy it now from: Tech21 Evo Check Evoke Edition Case ($50)
This clear case shows off your new iPhone 8 design, but adds a touch of style with a floral design, and a whole lot of protection with three layers capable of withstanding falls of up to 10 feet. There are chunky, well-designed button covers that are easy to find without looking and accurate cutouts with plenty of room for third-party cables. With Tech21’s stringent testing , you can be rest assured your iPhone 8 is safe in this case. Buy it now from: Greenwich Chrono Folio Case ($109)
There simply aren’t enough purple cases in the world, so this attractive option from Greenwich Design caught our eye. It’s expensive, but the maker boasts that it’s finished in the world’s finest bull hide leather and, thanks to a hidden carbon fiber lining, can stop a shotgun blast. The cover can also be folded back and used with magnetic mounts. Cutouts offer access to all buttons and ports, and there’s an opening for the camera, too. This case comes with a lifetime guarantee and if you don’t like the damson, there are many other colors to choose from. Buy it now from: Spigen Ultra Hybrid Case ($12)
When you buy a new iPhone 8, there’s a good chance that you want to show it off. This case from Spigen allows you to do just that with a crystal clear or tinted polycarbonate back panel and a TPU frame that comes in clear or a variety of different colors. The button covers are good, the cutouts are spot on, and the bumper provides military grade drop protection to ensure your iPhone 8 isn’t damaged in the event of a minor tumble. Buy it now from: UAG Pylo Series Case ($40)
With reinforced corners and an impact resistant core, this iPhone 8 case can shrug off falls and bumps. You get the same tough protection, oversized button covers, and skid pads as the rest of UAG’s range, but the Pylo cases have a plainer design. This case comes in clear, tinted gray, or tinted red (pictured). It’s quite chunky, but it provides solid protection and enhances grip considerably. Buy it now from: Proporta Ted Baker Shannon Mirror Folio Case ($50)
This folio case comes in muted apricot or gray with a perfectly fitted, electroplated shell to hold your iPhone 8 snug and secure. The cover has a soft, leather-style finish and it opens to reveal a surprise. You might expect to find pockets for credit cards, but instead there’s a mirror. The shell is minimal with the full range of required cutouts. This isn’t a rugged drop protection case, but it does cover all angles, so will serve well if you usually put your iPhone 8 in a bag. The Ted Baker branding appears inside and out. Buy it now from: Amazon Proporta

Jennie Lay / Seminars at Steamboat
Take heart folks, the same way Apple changed the music scene and Amazon changed the way people shop, some brilliant innovation could be one of the ways America helps solves its health care crisis.
Stuart Butler, one of the nation's leading policy wonks on health care, walked a Steamboat audience through his ""Bipartisan Roadmap for the U.S. Health System"" on Monday night. Listen / 59:53 Stuart Butler, one of the nation's leading policy wonks on health care, walks a Steamboat audience through his ""Bipartisan Roadmap for the U.S. Health System.""
Butler was born in England and educated there before emigrating to the U.S. in 1975 at age 28. He spent 35 years at the conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation, specializing in policy innovation and is now senior economics fellow at the Brookings Institution.
""Health care is really ripe for this (dramatic innovation),"" Butler told a packed crowd during the summer's first Seminars at Steamboat policy talk at the Strings Music Pavilion. ""The model for health care hasn't really changed that much … big institutions with networks and associations. It's absolutely wide open to dramatic change.""
He pointed out that Amazon is currently working with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway to come up with ideas to address the health care system. He also reassured the audience that despite the perceived gridlock in politics, liberals and conservatives like himself and people in between have actually been meeting and working on ways to improve the system. Stuart Butler taking questions from the audience during his talk at Seminars at Steamboat. Credit Jennie Lay / Seminars at Steamboat
Butler, who helped develop Massachusetts' famous Romney Care, went on to outline his view on health care and the best way to come to a consensus.
First, he said the United States' federalist system provides a great way to experiment, even under the Affordable Care Act. While safeguarding rules like insurance companies not being able to drop coverage, the government and ACA, Butler said, allow states to experiment with different venues, and it's like having 50 different labs to see what works and doesn't work.
""Federalism gives us an opportunity to cut through arguments and actually see what the facts show on the ground with particular approaches,"" Butler said. ""I strongly believe as we allow states to experiment in health care … over time, we will build a much stronger consensus, a bipartisan consensus, about changes in the health system.""
Secondly, Butler said the nation needs to widen the meaning of health care services to include improving things not directly related to medical services. He pointed out that the CDC estimates $50 billion a year is spent on treating elderly people who fall in simple accidents involving baths, steps and other unsafe surroundings. Listen / 20:33 An extended Q&A with health care policy expert Stuart Butler, a speaker at 2018's Seminars at Steamboat.
""If we were to invest the money into unsafe bathrooms, for example, or steps that aren't sound, we could save an enormous amount of money,"" Butler said. ""We spend far too much on medical care and far too little on things that contribute to bad health.""
He backed up his statement with a power point that showed countries that spent more on social services had smaller medical costs.
""There's more and more attention being given to non-medical factors … it isn't partisan any more … it's about how to develop good health care,"" he said.
Butler pointed to Mary's Center, a system of clinics devoted to mostly immigrant families in the Washington, D.C. area. Butler serves as chairman of the Mary's Center's board of directors. Not only do the clinics provide health care to children, but they have organized with 18 schools to help with social services like mental and behavioral health, literacy programs and pregnancy prevention.
But Butler said the work they do in these schools is funded by private means and not the government, because of holes in the system that don't allow funding to go to places where it will do the most good.
""We need to focus on how to get social services, housing and medical care working together,"" Butler added.
In the end, Butler left the Steamboat audience buzzing with optimism and laughter, ending his talk with a quote from Winston Churchill: ""You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing, after they have tried everything else.""

Here are only two of my visual samples for the interior of their famed Opera House in Manaus. The second view is from one of the two grand boxes that were immediately overlooking the stage for the rich rubber barons who lived here during the peak years of their economy.:
(Open your screen/viewer wider to see these pictures larger/better!)
Here is just one sample from our little ""walk"" in the rainforest 60 miles north of Manaus. Fortunately, no rain for us. But, we would have other challenges. When you walk into the ""jungle"", you get out of the sun and can really feel things not being as hot. BUT, it was still very humid. Christine, our guide from Amazon Ecco Adventure Tours, did an excellent job and was super hard-working as we ""progressed"" along these complicated trails that gave us a taste from being an explorer like Indiana Jones.:
Before going ashore in Manaus on our last day there, this is one of the views while having breakfast. We could see many of the nearby smaller ""commuter"" ships being loaded with goods and people. We were docked right in the ""heart"" for all of the por t ""action""!! :
Visiting t he markets of Manaus, including those that are more for wholesale fish, produce, etc., was bo th fund and in teres ting. Plus, free to do on our own. First shown is a typical local food, take-away style place. The next picture shows some from the fish market that was s timula ting to experience, sample the human interactions, etc.:"

YES! Can share much more. Happy to answer any ques tions on my live/blog and provide added info/background. As an example, here is these ideas for Manaus:
From the CNN news ne twork las t fall, they had this headline: B est things to do in Manaus  with these highlights:  A city of 1.8 million people surrounded by 2 million square miles of Amazon jungle more than 1,500 miles from Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, it doesn't get as many tourists as those two cities. Manaus is a gold mine of brightly colored architecture, riverfront views and world-class eating, minus the huge crowds. At the turn of the 20th century, Manaus was the center of a lucrative global trade in rubber. Today, it's the gateway for thousands of tourists seeking Amazon jungle adventures at the many lodges outside the city. 
For a key attraction we loved in Manaus, this article shared: ""Manaus' Amazonas Theater (aka Teatro Amazonas or simply The Opera House) is an opulent ode to the rubber boom of the 1800s when rubber barons and the local government had more money than they knew what to do with. Some of that windfall was used for the construction of the theater. It took 15 years to complete and includes tiles, stained glass and other elements brought from Europe.""
Many more de tails and pic tures of Manaus a re on my live/blog tha t is connec ted below. Will try to share a few visual samples on this thread that can be helpful for those planning fu ture travel in this amazing par t of the world.

I actually know more people moving to Illinois than moving out; though - I can only speak to the 20-30's age range. However, I do know that a lot of African Americans are leaving Chicago for Atlanta and Dallas, and retirees leave for places like Phoenix and Tampa. There's really no mass exodus here because Wisconsin taxes are almost as high as they are in Illinois. If you wanted to move to avoid rising taxes, you wouldn't move to Wisconsin.
The local media doesn't mention it at all really. If you go to Chicago - you really wouldn't notice the state is in fiscal crisis. There's new skyscrapers being built everywhere downtown and the West Loop. Even in the suburbs you notice new factories and office buildings off of I-90; Sub Zero, Zurich America, etc. Chicago seems to be thriving, but downstate is really getting hammered.
Edit: If there's one place really benefiting from it all, it would probably be the Kenosha area. Companies want the benefit of being in the Chicago metro, while also getting free goodies from Walker. Recently Haribo, Amazon, and of course Foxconn have all built in the area.
Edit 2: Wisconsin lost 5,300 private sector jobs in May, so we're not exactly doing all that great up here either. I agree. I think Chicago is in better shape than Wisconsin as a whole. Scott Walker won't admit that Wisconsin is trailing neighboring Minnesota to the west and Chicago because he's desperate to hold onto his political power. Hopefully Wisconsinites will make Wisconsin great again and vote blue!"

Ditch the stock air shock and get a hyperpro (what I run) or another high quality shock.
At the very least put better springs in the forks.
I run Michelin ultra heavy duty tubes and carry a 21” lower quality tube just in case. Packs smaller and you can run a 21” in the rear if need be. The Michelin UHD tubes most certainly don’t pack small. These are definitely the gold standard and the best you can get IMO.
I Also carry a patch kit.
You can find the stock air pump on amazon. Don’t remember the brand name. It’s pretty cheap.
As stated above any yz 450 shifter will work.
Lighting opinions are many but remember the power on the X is limited so LED is the way to go. You might start with a replacement bulb from cyclops.
If your gonna run low tire pressure do run at least a rear rim lock and high quality tubes."

If it actually makes it to series, I'll probably avoid.
I love Buffy, warts and all. I have UK DVDs so there so whilst it's nice having a 16:9 picture like 95% of the time, the bad bit is seeing all the stuff we shouldn't see as it was Joss' intention for it to be presented in 4:3. I used to have the whole series on VHS as well so I still considered it an upgrade.
I'd love a blu-ray set, and I'd be first in line to buy it! Considering that the CGI would have to be done from scratch though, it's probably too expensive with too little return. Star Trek fans face the same problem with DS9 and VOY, where both series were full of CGI, and filmed on film. Well, I might be mis-remembering it - suffice it to say, wasn't very future-proof.

The blocking of YouTube and hobbling of sideloading is extremely annoying, that along with the fact I can only use the SHOW to play Amazon videos is so annoying and short sighted.
I have Silicon Dust OTA tuner devices but can't use the SHOW to see them!!! WHY CAN'T I CAST VIDEO FROM MY AFTV OR CUBE TO THE SHOW
I'm done with Amazon and their lack luster devices that could be so much more, your CUBE can't even select my antenna input or change my OTA TV channel and your SHOW can't play Youtube or Netflix. Stop tryimg to force me to be an Amazon Prime Memeber, I was at one time but now that membership is too expensive, I refuse to be railroaded in to becoming a Prime member and so my Show and Cube devices will sit quietly on the shelf awaiting an upgrade that makes them truely worth the money I spent on them.

Kylie Jenner/Kardasian needs your help! I recently read the heart wrenching news that Kylie only has $900 million through her cosmetics company! Due to us living in this marvelous age, we can do our part to get her over the hump and become a billionaire. You can donate to a GoFundMe page to raise that much needed 100 million. Folks, our Jason has done his part by buying her products, now it’s your turn! [Editor’s Note: Please don’t!]
On not quite as grand of a scale, if you’re into scary things and all that goes with it, you can help out an up and coming project by going to the Kickstarter campaign of “The Horror Box”. I met these fine people at the recent Galactic Con held at the Howard County Fairgrounds near Columbia, Maryland. They had a promotion whereby you spin a wheel and always won a small prize (I scored me a horror/energy drink!). Go to the horrorbox.com to find out how YOU can score some swell stuff.
The show, as far as being a comic booker dealer was concerned, was a disappointment. The building was cavernous so it was hard to judge the attendance–the wide aisles were never packed. Regardless, there weren’t many comic book seekers that day. If not for sales to another dealer, who was going be at the following week’s First State Comic Con anyway, I would have lost money. There was some drama at the show, though. Legos seem to be back and there were quite a few set up hawking those terribly expensive pieces of plastic. Two purveyors of these little bricks and figures were set up next to each other and one was upset that his neighbor wasn’t selling Legos, but look-alike, third party items. He actually built a sign out of Legos with an arrow pointing to the table of the seller of “Fake Legos”.
As mentioned, the following week was the First State Comic Con, held roughly twice a year, here in good ol’ Delaware. Yes, my savior from the previous week was set-up, so he didn’t stop by my tables, but I did fine anyways. I gave dealers and “regular” people the same sale and by the amount sold to dealers, my prices must be too low. Even so, with attendance down at this show compared to previous ones (according to the promoters), I sold more than 6 times as much to “regular” customers than the week before. This, in a show in tiny Delaware, with what a number of people have told me, had more comics in the room than to be found at a Wizard World Con!
More drama! Most of my evenings feature vegetating in front of the boob tube catching cop shows – just discovered “Bosch” (unfortunately, you’ll need Amazon prime to get it). No “reality” shows for me, I like my drama shows, but not in real life. Another comic book-related drama occurred last week as I attended an auction with lots and lots of comics. Where? down near Columbia, Maryland, again.
About 30 boxes and crates were up for grabs. Most were mixed-up accumulations with some scattered gems among the groups. Two long boxes, however, were definitely from someone’s organized collection. One was nothing but Batman and the other was nothing but Detective comics. Both runs started with 10 centers and were near complete runs. The Batman issues began with number 134, skipped a few, and then was pretty much solid from 150 to about 360. The 171 (1st Riddler) was really nice, the 181 (1st Poison Ivy) was decent, the 232 (1st Ras al Ghul) was perhaps a VG, as were the rest of the Neal Adams issues. The box of Detectives featured an almost complete run from 295 to 500. The big key, # 359 (1st Batgirl), was just a VG. Another long box contained an Amazing Spider-Man run from 110 – 233 (missing 121, 122, and 129!!) plus Peter Parker #64 (1st Cloak and Dagger), Daredevil 132-190, and others. I found ASM 238 and 239 in another box. Daredevil 131 (1st Bulleye) was in another. The Watchmen run was spread out among the boxes. If one looked carefully, a hidden Swamp Thing 37, New Teen Titans 2, silver age Flash, Green Lanterns, Brave and the Bolds, and Justice Leagues could be found. The most interesting box to me had a run of Ms. Marvels 1-22, Star Wars 1 – 39 with two #1s, the first two issues of Iron Fist, early Black Panthers, a nice group of first series What Ifs, Peter Parker 1-36, and a copy of Marvel Comics Special #1 with real Kiss blood! .
High bidder had his/her choice of one or as many boxes wanted at that bid. I checked my notes and the Batman box went first at $1700 (plus an additional $255 in buyer’s premium). I thought that getting it for $1500 would have been a good deal for me, although after selling off the keys, I’d have to wait a while to recoup my full investment. I had my eyes set on that last box above. Well, here’s where the drama set in. With that first box of comics bringing WAY more than any of the other items sold so far in auction, the auctioneer said that he thought the buyer should take care and watch the lot, since they had a thief the week before. Then he quickly said that with the 8 cameras in the room, it shouldn’t be a problem – they identified the culprits – a couple, with a stroller, no less.
That set off a storm when a woman in the second row stood up and protested. I was in the back and could not hear every word, but did hear her claim that she was the only one with a stroller that week. The auctioneer tried to get her to listen and said she could go to the office and view the tapes herself – that he would join her after the auction, but had business to take care of currently. After an extended discussion, seemingly going nowhere, she left, only to return later, and left again. I stayed until the comics were all sold, but the atmosphere in the room really went downhill – things seemed awkward. The second box to go was the Detectives, at a cost of $1500 plus BM. Everything went for much more than I was comfortable. As I left, empty-handed, I saw the woman in the office with several others. Maybe I’ll find out more next month, as more comics were promised to be in the next auction.
Next up – Dover Comic Con – Saturday, August 18th. I will not be bringing major books but WILL have loads of new ‘dollar” books and sets that have never been in the shop! After that, our Labor Day Flea Market!
By the time you read this, the new Overstreet Price Guide will have arrived. Ya better grab up those back issues before I get a chance to jack up my prices! Events at Captain Blue Hen"

Fortunately it isn’t! Load Balancers . What are they? LBs are the middle-men between computers and servers. I think that is a simple explanation for them. They receive requests from computers and will direct that request to the proper server based on conditions or rules placed on them. This is important for many reasons. We normally don’t think about these things when we open up our laptop or turn on our PC — at least I didn’t — not until recently when my friend Patrick suggested we look into it for a presentation. Service Think of Instagram or Facebook  — they have numerous users around the world using their site or app simultaneously . This wouldn’t be possible without a load balancer! Instagram, Facebook, Netflix  — they all have countless amounts of servers located around the world in convenient locations for processing requests and sending information over the internet. If a server is receiving too many requests at once, or if the server isn’t working at its best capacity due to a technical issue, or if the power goes out, this could lead to users being unable to access their profiles, share funny pet videos, or watch a livestream of their favorite people. This would be a catastrophe for users and that directly influences their perspective on the company. This is even more important nowadays with so many alternative services and applications out there — just have a look at the Google Play Store. Purpose Rules, algorithms, and conditions placed on load balancers are necessary for determining where to send the requests to. Servers are not all the same — some are built for a specific purpose. A server could be built for managing images, another server could be for videos, and another could be for web pages. Potentially an image request being sent to a server made for web pages could impact the server in terms of speed and processing. By prescheduling these rules on a load balancer, you are preemptively avoiding overloading servers and servers’ overall condition. This ultimately saves you overhead costs, supervision, and losing customers. Access Security  — it’s a thing, you’ve probably heard about it. Privacy  — it’s also a thing. These two are connected in many ways and load balancers is a layer of protection of your data and information. Since LBs direct traffic, DOS (denial-of-service) attacks are well mitigated. A DOS attack is used to overflow servers and with a load balancer you are directing the traffic amongst many servers which would avoid servers crashing and access to the servers. I remember when Google’s servers went down for a short period and I couldn’t access my Gmail — it made me realize how much I depended upon their service, their servers, and how screwed I would be if the servers didn’t come back online much sooner. You can’t speak about load balancers without mentioning scaling and fault tolerance. Scaling Netflix, you know the video streaming service everyone’s lives depend on — otherwise you’ve heard it from Netflix and Chill . Traditionally when you gained more users and traffic on your website or application, you would do a number of things which include getting another server. This is costly in terms of the price of a server, maintenance and overhead and simply opportunity cost in a sense. What if your application was a one-hit-wonder and loses traffic and users in a short period of time? You’re still stuck with the server. And then what if you somehow manage to keep things going?? Cloud environments such as provided by AWS , Amazon Web Services, is perfect for such a case. They will charge you for the services actually being used. If traffic spurs up, in a matter of clicks you can add another server and load balancer to manage it all. And more importantly, you can decommission it when things slow down and avoid having to pay more than you need. Just think about when most people use Netflix to watch their shows and movies and drown out their misery of their 9–5 lives. Fault Tolerance In August of 2008, Netflix’s in-house server was down and they were unable to ship out DVDs to their customers. Yep, Netflix used to deliver DVDs via the post to their clients before moving onto the internet! One issue lead to the complete shutdown of their business until it could be resolved. They came to the realization that they were terrible at managing servers on their own, and frankly they didn’t want to bother with it — they were costly, time-consuming, inefficient and a disaster waiting to happen. They took a gamble and went with AWS — they were relatively still new to the cloud game then. With AWS’ servers and load balancing services, Netflix can manage numerous servers across the globe and redirect traffic and streaming service to their customers from one location to another in a matter of minutes without them realizing any issues — for example, moving US East to Europe would take approximately 6 minutes , again, without interruptions or noticeable changes in service. But when do I need one? This was a common question for us when we gave our presentation — it really depends on the application. It’s safe to say that if you have multiple servers , you should have a load balancer. When you sign up for AWS, you actually have a load balancer option and can get one right away. And then when should you get more load balancers and/or servers? This depends on the traffic you are getting and the demand your servers are receiving — if you notice that some of your servers are working near capacity then it may be wise to add another server. And how should I know when to add another load balancer? I can’t say for sure but load balancers have rules and schedules assigned to them to redirect traffic accordingly. If for some reason your application includes a new type of media, then perhaps you could simply add another rule to the load balancer and have it redirect traffic for such requests to specific servers. Consider this — your sole load balancer fails , then what? The traffic requests sent from the client computer (your customers) cannot access any of your servers and thus they’re stuck with no access. This is why it is wise to have multiple load balancers in case of failure or unforeseen circumstances."

We like your stuff and we love technology. We have over a half dozen devices, and two prime accounts going in our family of 5. Multiple Echos, a Tap, and the husband unit even has one of those Echos with the screen. As a designer & maker, and someone who does not purchase a lot of RTW, the Echo Look could be useful. I like technology to help humans be better. The Echo Look really could help with more responsible consumption and fewer bad fast-fashion purchases (which means fewer returns.) Also, for those of us really involved in #mmmay - there are quite a few people out there who have a hard time keeping up the whole month, and this could be the answer. Hopefully this is fixed by 2019 for #mmmay19
Ok. That was the good part and to counter the really lame trolls on here. Be part of the solution. Seriously.
I’ve had the Echo Look for 2 weeks now.
Went into the store 4 days ago, hoping an employee could answer questions. Employees had never even seen one, and pointed me to the phone number for customer service.
Today I called customer service. First I talked to TK, who tried to tell me that Amazon wasn’t available at this time (um, I’m in the same time-zone). That was funny, and not in a good way. TK told me that they only trouble shoot problems and that they can’t forward my call to the design team (which I did not ask for, I asked for someone on his team that knew about app/device updates and about using the Echo Look.) TK forwarded me to “George” - I will note that George started out with an American Southern accent which he quickly lost as he went back to his native language accent. I”m not sure what the point of that was....? I think after he realized I wasn’t Grandma complaining about not being able to get ther Fire stick to work, he dropped the fake southern accent. George actually tried to first talk me into returning the device. You might want to look into that. George didn’t know anything either, and eventually told me to write a review here. The Catch-22 is amazing. The store knows nothing and points consumers to the phone people. The phone people are irritable, they do not like that I’m asking device & app update questions, they don’t know anything, and point consumers to return the product or write a review here.
Ok, now to my problems and requests for solutions.
1. Pre, what, 2000, I was that person that got red-eye when not even looking at the camera. Technology and cameras have advanced so that isn’t an issue...or I pull out the DSLR and use an external flash - but even then, my DSLR is new enough it doesn’t really have those issues. The Echo Look’s 4 LEDs are SO bright, I look like a Replicant from Blade Runner. No exaggeration. It’s like you went back in time with technology. Not even looking at the camera, I still get retina refraction like crazy. I tried putting scotch tape over the LEDs to soften the impact which reduces the Replicant look by 50% but then the app doesn’t like that and tells me something is wrong and till not apply any of the filters or the blurry vignette feature (Pop.) You have to fix this. I’m NOT alone. Going through Instagram for EchoLook photos is like Replicant Tinder. You’ve got to do a hardware OS update and fix that, and/or allow the app to reduce flash brightness.
2. Let’s talk about Pop or the weird blurry vignette slider that isn’t really a slider. Yes, it is helpful, but please update app so that slider is really a slider. Right now it is A. Nothing. B. You’re floating in a blurry cloud C. You’re actually swimming in amniotic fluid.
3. The fashion compare options. HAHAHA. Oh. Please. The algorithm is set to 1950. Seriously, try it. Put on, say, nice linen overalls with a wide leg, paired with a mid-volume silk shirt - totally on trend, and put it next to an outfit that looks like it was bought from Chicos (think princess seamed button up shirt in novelty print, and a defined waist-pant, and it picks the Chicos outfit every time. Fit & Flare isn’t the only design aesthetic, thanks. Please update app to have style preferences. Think Stitch Fix or the Nordstrom version of Stitch Fix...it’s for men, so my husband uses it, not me, but they’re VERY good. You’re in the same town as Blake, just go over and ask him how they set up the Nordstrom version of Stitch Fix, ‘kay??
4. You may need a more diverse group working on this product. I’ll let you figure out that one, but I’ll give you a hint. If you gear something towards women, with ONLY women in ALL of the product demos, then maybe there should be more women, particularly women in fashion/design, involved in the process. Also...you may want to diversify your product demos... lovely range of women with POCs...all the same size and age range. And just women. Call me, I’ll help you.
5. I shouldn’t have to pull this all into PhotoShop. This should be plug-in-play directly to Instagram. You’re losing SO much with all of these issues. Your Echo Look account isn’t even used - I’ve got a stinking suspicion you’re already planning on dropping this product. I can’t find ANY reviews other than the PR release you GAVE out. I seriously don’t care what 40+ year old hetero white men not in fashion/design have to say about this product, nor what they forced their single female staffer to do with it. There’s NOTHING. Which tells me there’s suppression, and possibly such a great loss already you’re looking to bag out completely and are ready to erase it. I’d prefer you supported it instead. It wasn’t a bad idea. I prefer it to having to set up my DSLR or propping my iPhone on my tripod...but my iPhone takes way better photos and has a portrait option that rivals my DSLR. That and no replicant.

Have no issues with that. But, this solution needs the AWS credentials to be stored on the EC2 instance to generate the authentication token (which is used instead of password). Based on AWS best practices ( docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/… ) we should not store AWS credentials onto EC2 instances. Instead, define an IAM role that has appropriate permissions for our application and launch the Amazon EC2 instance with roles for EC2. – Malgi 2 days ago @Malgi, this does not require storing credentials on the instance, and it isn't clear why you are under the impression that it does. If you do not configure aws-cli with a key and secret, it automatically uses the IAM instance role credentials. – Michael - sqlbot yesterday @Michael-sqlbot Have you done this before? I will update my question with some screenshots of why I am saying this requires AWS creds stored onto the EC2 instance. – Malgi 48 mins ago Yes, I have done this, using the instance's IAM role. The most likely explanation is that your IAM role does not have the necessary policy statements to allow access... or you granted the role the correct permissions, but did not wait long enough for them to take effect. Changes to role policies for EC2 instance roles can sometimes require a few minutes before they start working. – Michael - sqlbot 17 mins ago Since a token generated using a role has a slightly different structure than one generated with an access key and secret, another possibility here is that you have an edge case where you need to supply --password=""$TOKEN"" for the shell to correctly handle your token. ""When referencing a variable, it is generally advisable to enclose its name in double quotes."" – Michael - sqlbot 17 mins ago"

Many of those reviews are anecdotal and that is a red flag. The amount of evidence showing any long-term benefits is pretty limited.
Is there something inadequate about your current oil? Do you have your own evidence that this additive is needed?"

We’re sometimes guilty of being a little fickle when it comes to older phones. As new toys arrive, and release cycles grind on, phones from years past are left to collect dust.
The Google Pixel 2 XL is an exception. It has unquestionably aged better than just about any Google phone before it, be it a Nexus or a Pixel. For a phone that had a tumultuous launch, thanks to some concerns around the display, the Pixel 2 XL stood the test of time better than I could’ve imagined.
We’re still a few months away from the next generation of Pixel phones, and with the final version of Android 9.0 dropping very soon, plus price drops on the Google store and elsewhere, this phone is still a tempting proposition. If you care about having the latest Android software and Google features, then the Pixel 2 will be running software in August that other flagships like the Note 9 probably won’t get until at least a couple months into 2019.
Of course, there’s more to a phone than the version of Android it runs. The Pixel 2 XL is a generation behind the current crop of high-end Androids if you just look at the spec sheets. You get last year’s Snapdragon 835 instead of this year’s 845. 4GB of RAM versus the increasingly standard six.
Real-world performance, though, is basically on par with many of the Snapdragon 845 phones we’ve been using over the past few months, with only tiny differences in app load speeds. Even then, it’s pretty much a coin toss as to which one feels faster to use. The only downside I’ve really seen has to do with that four gigabytes of RAM. Compare it to the OnePlus 6, for instance, with its monstrous eight gigs of RAM, and it’s clear OnePlus’s phone is the superior multitasker.
Having the latest version of Android is all well and good — the Pixel 2 XL will have Android 9 comfortably before any other phone. And it’s guaranteed for platform updates through until Android R in 2020. But the real strengths of the Pixel comes from the extra stuff Google’s layered on top. Features like “Now Playing”, which identifies music playing when you’re out and about, are things that still delight me whenever I switch back to the Pixel. And then there’s the legendary Pixel camera, which is so good mostly because of the HDR+ processing that Google’s developed over the past few years.
Sure, there are ports of the Pixel camera for other phones, but none work as well as the real deal on a Pixel 2. Pixel 2 camera’s still got it. pic.twitter.com/W1Nz4UyZbG
— Alex Dobie (@alexdobie) July 18, 2018
This is still a top-three camera. Although it’s beaten in one or two areas by the Galaxy S9 and Huawei P20 Pro, the Pixel’s camera is absolutely a reason to recommend it over other flagships. It’s not quite the best anymore in low light, but it still captures a ton of color detail in the dark. And dynamic range is spectacularly good. Photos from the Pixel 2 have a magical quality that’s hard to replicate on any other handset. And it’s still the camera, more than anything, that lures me back to a Pixel now and again, even when reviewing newer and shinier things.
Something else that’s held up surprisingly well is this phone’s battery life. Even after around nine months of use, with hardware that’s a generation old, my Pixel 2 XL’s longevity compares favorably to the Galaxy S9+, OnePlus 6, LG G7, HTC U12+ and just about any other 2018 flagship you might care to mention. (The only exception being Huawei’s Mate 10 and P20 Pro, with their extra-large batteries.)
The Pixel 3 is just around the corner. Nevertheless, if you can find the Pixel 2 XL with a reasonable discount, it’s absolutely still worth picking up. The phone was briefly discounted on the Google Store, but most outlets have reverted back to the $ 849 base price, which you definitely shouldn’t pay. If you are buying outright, Amazon has a few refurb options at a more palatable price point."

Here’s everything you’ll need to know once you dive under
Indie developer Unknown Worlds Entertainment has partnered with console development extraordinaire Panic Button (known for the recent Nintendo Switch ports of DOOM and Wolfenstein II) to bring Subnautica to PlayStation 4. Soon everyone can get a taste of what lies beneath the sea.
If you have thalassophobia , this isn’t the game for you. What is Subnautica?
Subnautica is an adventure survival game that allows players to explore its underwater world to their heart’s content. This is no ocean you’ll be familiar with, however, as it is set on an alien planet with unknown threats. Whether you’re exploring a long-forgotten cave system, building a base, harvesting plant life and resources, or encountering some of Subnautica’s otherworldly creatures, there’s activities for everyone to enjoy. Story
As I mentioned earlier, Subnautica doesn’t take place on Earth. When humanity begins to colonize other planets in the late 22nd century and a faster method of travel is needed, you’re sent out to construct such a device. While doing so, you’re also tasked with scanning a planet known as 4546B for signs of another ship that has been missing for nearly a decade. Whatever befell that ship appears to have struck yours as you’re hit with an energy pulse and crash land on 4546B. What awaits you is the mysterious tale of an ancient civilization and its quest to save its dying race. As the story unfolds, you’ll see just what measures they went to in order to try and ensure survival. Murky depths: Environment
Planet 4546B is full of exotic locations to explore. As the developer states, there are “sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers” among its diverse offerings. You’re not just skimming the rocky ocean floor. You’ll be discovering a whole alien ecosystem that sustains various forms of life. Some of these out there may help you on your journey, while others may be looking to turn you into a snack. No pressure.
For some encouragement to dive deep into these areas, you’ll also be able to locate crafting blueprints and maps to help you survive. The danger should be well worth the effort. So if you thought you could just be content in your little corner of the ocean (do oceans have corners?), you’re sadly mistaken. That is, depending on what mode you choose to play in. Treacherous Survival: Gameplay
Survival sims tend to turn a lot of people off as the constant threat of death and micromanagement of resources can seem intimidating instead of a fun challenge. Luckily Subnautica has several modes that players can enjoy so they aren’t forced to deal with frustrating survival mechanics. Survival mode
Survival is essentially Subnautica’s “normal” mode. You must manage your oxygen, hunger, and thirst to stay alive. Should you die, you’ll lose all of your resources and respawn. Your items will be at the location where you died so you can still attempt to gather what you lost.
There are ways to ensure that you don’t lose everything you’ve worked so hard for. By entering either a Lifepod 5, a Seabase, or a Cyclops, you can secure your inventory. This means that whenever you die, you’ll keep whatever items were in your inventory the last time you secured it in one of the three aforementioned structures. Hardcore mode
Hardcore, as you can probably guess, isn’t for the faint of heart, and is meant for more serious survival sim fans looking for the greatest challenge. This mode features permadeath, so once you die, it’s game over. You’re only given one life, and the game completely begins anew should you meet your demise. Freedom mode
If you don’t want to risk life and limb, there is a Freedom mode for your enjoyment. This mode takes out the stress of managing your resources so you won’t need to worry about dying of hunger or thirst. However, similar to Survival, you will need to to keep an eye on your oxygen levels. Creative mode
And if Freedom is just a tad too intense for you, there’s always a Creative mode. Think of this like Creative in Minecraft. You’re open to explore at your leisure without worrying about any hazards since your character cannot die. You can also craft anything without needing the usual required materials and blueprints to do so. Lastly, your bases and vehicles do not consume energy in this mode. VR support?
Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Subnautica will support PlayStation VR for the time being , despite supporting the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Unknown Worlds attributes this to the difficulty of getting Subnautica to run at the high frame-rates that VR requires. The team is already struggling to achieve a smooth 30 FPS on consoles, and VR would require at least 60 FPS. So for now don’t get your hopes up for a PSVR release, but never say never. There’s always the chance that Unknown Worlds will revisit the possibility in the future. When can you play it?
Subnautica first released into Steam Early Access in 2015 and into Xbox Game Preview in 2016, so if you prefer either of those platforms you’re good to go. For everyone looking forward to the game on PlayStation 4, you’ll need to wait a bit longer.
Unknown Worlds Entertainment is currently aiming to release Subnautica on PlayStation 4 sometime this fall. An exact date is unknown at this time. Though both Amazon and GameStop list its release for Friday, December 7, this could be a placeholder date.
You can pre-order the physical retail version of Subnautica for $ 29.99. It’s unclear if this will differ from the price on the PlayStation Store should you purchase it digitally as it is priced at $ 24.99 on Steam and the PS Store does not have it listed yet. The Game Preview version on Xbox One costs $ 19.99. We’ll update this once a store page goes up on PlayStation’s end."

It means your hard drive has failed and needs to be replaced. What you need is a 3.5"" SATA3 drive of your preferred brand and capacity.
Example:
https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-BarraCuda-Cache-Desktop-ST2000DM006/dp/B01IEKG402/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&...
or you could opt for an SSD for better everyday performance (you will need a 2.5"" to 3.5"" bracket to install the SSD).
Starting on page 10 of the guide below you can see the steps to replace drive:
http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c03599028
You can also take a look at these HP videos for that model which can help with fix:

You will need to reinstall the OS on the drive, either by using recovery disks, migrating a backup image or by downloading media creation tool from Microsoft on different PC, running and creating a bootable pendrive with the OS on it. Windows will automatically activate once installed and connected to Internet.
For Windows 10
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10
If you choose this option you will need to use the pendrive to perform a clean install of Windows 10. You might need to disable fastboot and secure boot in BIOS. So, insert the pendrive in the PC and it should boot directly from the drive. If not, turn off PC by holding power button. Press power button and immediately keep pressing ESC until startup menu appears and then press F9 and choose the pendrive in boot menu. Once it boots from pendrive follow the procedure to install Windows. You do not need a product key as it is in the firmware. Windows will automatically activate once installed and connected to internet.
When finished installing allow Windows to completely update and find all or most drivers. You can follow this process by going into settings > Security and update > click on Verify for updates. You might need to reboot a couple of times. Once completely updated you can go into device manager and see if there are any missing drivers.
After this you can try attaching the old drive with a USB to SATA adapter and see if you are able to recover any files from it.
Hope it helps,
David

The beta reportedly includes phone call features, allowing the user to start and answer calls from the HomePod, as well as Find My iPhone Siri command, and perhaps most dramatically — support for multiple timers are apparently on the cards. Try Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial
The HomePod launched with a compelling speakerphone option, utilising its six-mic array to pickup the voices in the room. However, the device currently has no knowledge of the user’s contact book, so you cannot ask the HomePod to make a call.
Instead, users must initiate a call on their phone and then switch the audio output to the HomePod when the call begins. Similarly, if someone rings your phone, the HomePod does not ring. Users must pick up their iPhone to accept the call, and then optionally route the audio to the HomePod.
The report says these phone call features are forthcoming as they are in testing now. As well as dialing numbers and answering incoming calls, you will also be able to listen to voicemail and search your call history. At WWDC, Apple said the HomePod will be able to participate in group FaceTime calls as an audio-only participant.
Of course, Apple has not publicly promised of any of this stuff and final timelines are unknown. Some of the features currently in the extended private beta could be delayed to future releases.
Just like every other platform with the fall software update, HomePod OS 12.0 includes support for Find My iPhone so you can ask Siri to locate your iPhone (or any of your other devices) and make it play a sound. One other tidbit is that the Home app now includes a ‘fix Wi-Fi’ button (exact translation unclear). Tapping this makes the HomePod connect to the same Wi-Fi network as the paired iPhone; this was impossible before without fully resetting the HomePod. In fact, with the current HomePod firmware, a user cannot even know what SSID they are connected to.
The biggest news tucked into this report is that the beta supposedly includes multiple timers, so users can run more than one timer simultaneously. This is one of the most compelling aspects of Amazon Echo tubes in the kitchen; you can have a 60-minute timer named ‘cake’ and a ten-minute timer named ‘cookies’ running at the same time, for example. You can then ask the assistant for the status of a particular timer, and obviously both sound a tone when they time out. Unfortunately, an exact breakdown of what features the HomePod beta currently includes are not known; the release notes simply said ‘multiple named timers’.
The features covered in this report represent substantial upgrades for HomePod owners, and help flesh out much of the missing ‘personal assistant’ functionality when compared to Google Home or the Echo cylinders. Hopefully, customers will be able to start using at least some of these new functions in the September/October timeframe, when we also expect Apple to release iOS 12, macOS Mojave, watchOS 5 and tvOS 12."

July 5, 1779
July 3, 1779 was a Saturday. For Adjutant William Campbell and more than 3,000 other British and Hessian soldiers based in New York City, July 3 proved to be one terribly uncomfortable night. Soldiers, horses, cannon, and gear were all crammed together aboard two warships and 46 troop carriers bound for New Haven harbor.
Because of the still summer weather, it was slow going. The British armada took a day and a half to sail the 80 miles to New Haven. When the ships finally dropped anchor off of West Haven’s Bradley Point, it was already after midnight.
Most West Haveners were still sound asleep. Militia sentries, including West Haven’s Thomas Painter, were beside themselves. Running from one shoreline house to another, Painter warned of the British fleet offshore. Few paid much attention to the 20-year-old. Like many times before, they said, the fleet would sail off before daybreak. Frustrated, Painter buried his personal effects for safe keeping than anxiously awaited sunrise at Bradley Point.
Aboard the ships, Adjutant William Campbell also waited, likely recalling his last visit to the area some 20 years earlier. A member of Great Britain’s famed Third Guards, Campbell was a Scot Highlander who spoke both English and Gaelic. Born in 1742, the tall, some say strikingly handsome, Campbell originally came to the New Haven area as a private in Fraser’s Highlanders.
His unit stayed for several weeks in 1759 before advancing north to take part in the epic Battle of the Plains of Abraham in September of 1759. The outcome of that battle proved to be the deciding victory for the British over the French.
By late 1760 Campbell sailed for home where he had already made arrangements to join the Third Guards as a corporal. For the next 15 years, Campbell was stationed in London as part of King George’s personal bodyguards. It was a role in which he obviously excelled.
Tapped as the official recruiter of the Guards, Campbell occasionally toured Scotland in search of new recruits. Back in London, he earned a reputation for showing enviable restraint in helping to quell the infamous Wilkes riots of 1768. Promoted to sergeant, Campbell then married the widow of an army pal in 1772, and the couple had two children.
But Campbell’s idyllic life in the shadows Buckingham Palace soon came to an end.Drawing the proverbial “short straw,” he was tapped to return to America in June of 1776 as part of the army meant to crush the American rebellion.
Since that date, Campbell distinguished himself in leading the flanking guards of his regiment into a number of major battles against the Americans — from Long Island to Brandywine. By 1777 Campbell earned a field commission to the rank of ensign in 1777.
It was an extremely rare promotion in an age when officers’ commissions were usually bought outright, not earned on the field of battle. But then Campbell was no ordinary soldier… as he would soon prove when he set foot on West Haven’s shore.

Please note that this review may contain spoilers for Labyrinth Lost . You can read my review of this novel [here] .
Bruja Born was written by Zoraida Córdova and first published in 2018. It forms the second instalment of the Brooklyn Brujas series and is set eight months after the events of Labyrinth Lost (2016), as Lula and her family slowly recover from their ordeal in Los Lagos. Although this novel largely stands alone, I would still recommend reading the books in sequence to fully appreciate what is going on.
Lula Mortiz is a shadow of her former self. Although her sister, Alex, saved her from having her soul destroyed by a terrible monster, she has returned to New York traumatised and scared. Her anxiety has caused her relationship with her long-term boyfriend, Maks, to become strained and he eventually breaks it off, leaving Lula nursing a broken heart.
Desperate to keep Maks, Lula tries to use her healing magic to repair the rift between them. Yet, seconds later, disaster strikes. Lula’s school bus is involved in a horrific crash and many of her friends are killed. Although Lula survives, she learns that Maks is in a coma and is not expected to ever recover. When the circle refuses to heal him, Lula knows she needs to take matters into her own hands. Alex, Rose and herself command incredible power between them. It has to be enough to save him.
What should be a simple spell quickly goes wrong. When the Lady de la Muerte arrives to take Maks’s soul, Lula tethers it to herself to save him. While this at first seems to fail, the next day all of the bodies disappear from the hospital morgue. Its not long after that the killings begin. Bodies are showing up mutilated all over New York and Lula somehow knows that they are connected. Now she must find a way to put things right and appease the goddess of death. If she doesn’t, it won’t be long before she draws the attention of those who hunt for bruja…
Before I begin, a word of warning. Bruja Born does contain a few themes that readers may find distressing. These include gore, coping with grief and violence against women. While I wouldn’t say that anything in this book was inappropriate for its target audience, you might want to give this one a miss if you’re sensitive to such things. You have been warned.
Bruja Born is a strong sequel to the excellent Labyrinth Lost and does a fantastic job of widening the already impressive scope of its world-building. While the previous book was largely set in Los Lagos, this one is set entirely in the real world. I was a little disappointed about this at first but I did like the way that it gave this book a very different feel.
While Labyrinth Lost was fantastical and whimsical, Bruja Born is a lot more grounded in reality. While we do still see a little of more of the bruja culture, which still has its roots in a number of different Latinx folklores, Córdova takes the time in this book to build the bigger picture. We learn this time that there are actually many different supernatural creatures living in New York, and how they are governed by strict laws set down between their council and an order of hunters. We also learn how they keep all of this secret from muggles, which was something that wasn’t entirely clear in Labyrinth Lost .
The story this time is told in first person by Lula, who was a secondary character in the previous instalment. Lula is quick to impress upon the reader that this book is not a love story. This turns out to be entirely true. Bruja Born is a lot more introspective than Labyrinth Lost and tackles a number of complex themes. While the previous book did touch upon the unpleasant inevitability of death, Bruja Born takes this further in its themes of grief and coping with the loss of a loved one. While it was slower in pace than Labyrinth Lost , I quickly found myself hooked. The plot of Bruja Born is highly unpredictable and contained a lot of twists and turns that I genuinely did not see coming.
However, there were some moments where I felt as though the story had lost its way a little. I’m not going to spoil these for you here but I will just say that there were a few points where things just seemed to happen for the sake of plot progression. A good example of this is the hunt of the Lady de la Muerte’s spear. This seemed as though it would be integral to the plot, yet there was never a sense of the girls actually trying to look for it. They just seemed to figure out where it was at the eleventh hour, with no explanation as to why they jumped on this conclusion or how it came to be there.
Yet the story does end very well. While there are still threads left open to tie into a third book, it did feel as though this stage of the story has come to a satisfying close. While the books in this series don’t quite stand alone, the two instalments so far have provided strong character arcs for Alex and Lula respectively. However, much like Labyrinth Lost the epilogue does still close on rather a cheap cliff-hanger. I really hope that this one ties into the next book, as the one at the end of Labyrinth Lost only vaguely connected to Bruja Born , which was somewhat of a disappointment.
The characterisation of the Mortiz sisters is still one of the strongest aspects of this series. While I loved Alex in Labyrinth Lost , I think I grew even more attached to Lula. Her grief felt very natural, and her reaction to the breakup was believable. Despite her powers, she felt like a very normal teenage girl; one for whom love was all consuming and so she would do anything her power to maintain it. Over the course of the story, Lula is given some incredibly strong character development as she learns to love herself and understand the importance of letting go.
As this is really Lula’s story, her sisters get a lot less time to shine. However, it really was nice to have the three of them working together at last as it strengthens their circle and shows the depth of their love for each other. While I was disappointed at the diminished role that Alex played in this book (especially as her girlfriend Rishi is glaringly absent until the final chapter), Rose does get some interesting development towards the end of the story. I’m very curious to see where Córdova intends to take this in the next instalment.
So, all in all, I was really impressed by Bruja Born . It had strong world-building, a greatly sympathetic protagonist and a plot that kept me hooked from start to finish. I really can’t wait to see where this series will go next.
Bruja Born can be purchased as a Paperback, eBook and Audio Book on Amazon.co.uk "

Wenjie Dong/Getty Images
Looking back at the first six months of 2018, there haven't been as many government leaks and global ransomware attacks as there were by this time last year , but that's pretty much where the good news ends. Corporate security isn't getting better fast enough, critical infrastructure security hangs in the balance, and state-backed hackers from around the world are getting bolder and more sophisticated.
Here are the big digital security dramas that have played out so far this year—and it's only half over. Russian Grid Hacking
In 2017, security researchers sounded the alarm about Russian hackers infiltrating and probing United States power companies; there was even evidence that the actors had direct access to an American utility's control systems. Combined with other high-profile Russian hacking from 2017, like the NotPetya ransomware attacks, the grid penetrations were a sobering revelation. It wasn't until this year, though, that the US government began publicly acknowledging the Russian state's involvement in these actions. Officials hinted at it for months, before the Trump Administration first publicly attributed the NotPetya malware to Russia in February and then blamed Russia in March for grid hacking. Though these attributions were already widely assumed, the White House's public acknowledgement is a key step as both the government and private sector grapple with how to respond. And while the state-sponsored hacking field is getting scarier by the day, you can use WIRED's grid-hacking guide to gauge when you should really freak out. US Universities
In March, the Department of Justice indicted nine Iranian hackers over an alleged spree of attacks on more than 300 universities in the United States and abroad. The suspects are charged with infiltrating 144 US universities, 176 universities in 21 other countries, 47 private companies, and other targets like the United Nations, the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the states of Hawaii and Indiana. The DOJ says the hackers stole 31 terabytes of data, estimated to be worth $3 billion in intellectual property. The attacks used carefully crafted spearphishing emails to trick professors and other university affiliates into clicking on malicious links and entering their network login credentials. Of 100,000 accounts hackers targeted, they were able to gain credentials for about 8,000, with 3,768 of those at US institutions. The DOJ says the campaign traces back to a Tehran-based hacker clearinghouse called the Mabna Institute, which was founded around 2013. The organization allegedly managed hackers and had ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Tension between Iran and the US often spills into the digital sphere, and the situation has been in a particularly delicate phase recently. Rampant Data Exposures
Data breaches have continued apace in 2018, but their quiet cousin, data exposure, has been prominent this year as well. A data exposure, as the name suggests, is when data is stored and defended improperly such that it is exposed on the open internet and could be easily accessed by anyone who comes across it. This often occurs when cloud users misconfigure a database or other storage mechanism so it requires minimal or no authentication to access. This was the case with the marketing and data aggregation firm Exactis, which left about 340 million records exposed on a publicly accessible server. The trove didn't include Social Security numbers or credit card numbers, but it did comprise 2 terabytes of very personal information about hundreds of millions of US adults—not something you want hanging out for anyone to find. The problem was discovered by security researcher Vinny Troia and reported by WIRED in June. Exactis has since protected the data, but it is now facing a class action lawsuit over the incident.
Cloud leaks pop up regularly, but data exposures can also occur when software bugs inadvertently store data in a different format or location than intended. For example, Twitter disclosed at the beginning of May that it had been unintentionally storing some user passwords unprotected in plaintext in an internal log. The company fixed the problem as soon as it found it, but wouldn't say how long the passwords were hanging out there.
After the revelation of a data exposure, organizations often offer the classic reassurance that there is no evidence that the data was accessed improperly. And while companies can genuinely come to this conclusion based on reviewing access logs and other indicators, the most sinister thing about data exposures is that there's no way to know for sure what exactly went down while no one was watching. Under Armour
Hackers breached Under Armour's MyFitnessPal app in late February, compromising usernames, email addresses, and passwords from the app's roughly 150 million users. The company discovered the intrusion on March 25 and disclosed it in under a week—some welcome hustle from a large company. And it seems Under Armour had done a good enough job setting up its data protections that the hackers couldn't access valuable user information like location, credit card numbers, or birth dates, even as they were swimming in login credentials. The company had even protected the passwords it was storing by hashing them, or converting them into unintelligible strings of characters. Pretty great, right? There was one crucial issue, though: Despite doing so many things well, Under Armour admitted that it had only hashed some of the passwords using the robust function called bcrypt; the rest were protected by a weaker hashing scheme called SHA-1, which has known flaws. This means that attackers likely cracked some portion of the stolen passwords without much trouble to sell or use in other online scams. The situation, while not an all-time-worst data breach, was a frustrating reminder of the unreliable state of security on corporate networks. One to Watch: VPNFilter
At the end of May, officials warned about a Russian hacking campaign that has impacted more than 500,000 routers worldwide. The attack spreads a type of malware, known as VPNFilter, which can be used to coordinate the infected devices to create a massive botnet. But it can also directly spy on and manipulate web activity on the compromised routers. These capabilities can be used for diverse purposes, from launching network manipulation or spam campaigns to stealing data and crafting targeted, localized attacks. VPNFilter can infect dozens of mainstream router models from companies like Netgear, TP-Link, Linksys, ASUS, D-Link, and Huawei. The FBI has been working to neuter the botnet, but researchers are still identifying the full scope and range of this attack.

This blog is a wordhack on Dr. Jack Kruse the neurosurgeon, biohacker, Paleo blogger, who is a proponent of cold shock therapy, sunlight, and high dose vitamin D.
Kruse runs his findings through the lens of endocrine hormones, which he says control everything in the body. But what makes and controls hormones – what are their building blocks? Protein, fats, vitamins, and minerals with the most important mineral being magnesium.
What kind of attention does Kruse pay to magnesium? Not so much! Of course he says people should take magnesium but he adds that since it causes diarrhea you can’t take too much. He does not mention that it’s required for making energy, for vitamin D metabolism, hormones production, and supporting the thyroid and adrenals, which are among magnesium’s 800 different enzyme processes in the body.
According to his book outline on Amazon, Kruse is “A champion of ‘biohacking’ the art of tinkering with one’s own biology.” Of course when you use faulty data to perform your hack you are just going to get faulty results. Most biohackers put down the ineptness of medicine when it comes to chronic disease but they somehow think that ineptness doesn’t translate into the laboratory. They recommend all manner of lab testing so you can manipulate your diet, detox, supplements, and drugs – as if you actually know what you are doing!
First of all – labs are not foolproof and never offer the optimum values for a healthy body. And in the case of serum magnesium testing, they are just plain inaccurate. So why would you take Krause’s advice and spend a few thousand dollars every 3 months to run tests that aren’t accurate?
Step back a moment and look where biohacking to control “nature” has gotten us. Environmental pollution, rainforest devastation, fracking, nuclear meltdown to name a few. We’ve already biohacked our bodies to near death with antibiotics and magnesium depleting drugs. What makes a person think they can know enough to biohack their health by tinkering with their biology?
Krause makes the statement that “sunlight on our skin has our mitochondria create water in our cells” but he leaves out all the biochemical steps – such as performed by magnesium and other important vitamin and mineral cofactors. Biochemically it is actually well-absorbed minerals getting into cells that ultimately pulls in water? He’s big on mitochondria creating energy but that only happens if the Krebs cycle has enough magnesium for 6 of its 8 steps. It seems that Krause is missing the biochemical steps and just focusing on what he imagines to be the driving force of cellular quantum physics.
Energy medicine, including energy from the sun, to properly work in the body, needs minerals – especially magnesium. Minerals function as electron donors and acceptors in all biochemical reactions.
I’m probably being a bit too rough on Krause but I guess I’m just frustrated with all the “breakthrough” theories that the population has suffered over the past 50 years! Look at a short list of what we have endured with alternative medicine constantly turning up new theories and writing the definitive health book. Wheat intolerance, Gluten intolerance, Grain intolerance – Dozens of books Histamine intolerance – Over a dozen books Oxalate intolerance – A half dozen books Lectin intolerance: The Plant Paradox: The Hidden Dangers in Healthy Food Leptin resistance : Kruse’s book Epi-Paleo Rx MTHFR – Over a dozen books
In his book, Epi-Paleo Rx , Kraus enthuses about his personal cure for obesity and chronic disease and says it can be yours. But it comes with the price of wading through a few hundred pages of complicated hormone biochemistry and alternative medicine knowledge that Kruse has acquired in the last 7 years. It ends with him telling you that the cure is to pack your body with 40 pounds of ice to drop your temperature to 55 degrees and all will be well.
I am concerned that Kruse is offering an unattainable “cure” and his cold shock therapy will attract people who are too sick and toxic to take on such extreme therapies. After all, the means by which cold shock, heat shock, and extreme exercise work is to “damage” the body enough that it creates body-wide emergency survival reactions that stimulate various hormones and anti-inflammatory chemicals. Researchers get all excited when they measure these chemical reactions, but at what cost to the individual? What other chemicals are being depleted. In order to produce these hormones and chemicals how much have they dipped into their reserves of nutrients? These are unanswered questions.
After all, even simple sauna therapy depletes magnesium that most people don’t even realize and certainly don’t replace. The day after I did a number of ice water plunges going in and out of a sauna and Jacuzzi I developed a cold sore on my lip, which I hadn’t experienced in years. I presume the cold shock woke up my dormant herpes simplex virus and brought it to the surface. Such things happen under stress. Such stress under the guise of a health therapy will not be good for everyone.

At such time such an unlikely possibility might arise we can argue against it from within the EU and if that is really not what UK people want we can put it to a vote and leave.
When the time comes we will face a choice between being sidelined from a group we are even further entwined with or accepting it. I believe that by leaving now we can be in a better position than if we left later, even more closely linked with the EU.
You do realise that when people talk about 'free' trade the most likely victims of that are workers and consumers, not to mention the environment.
You're discussing possible competitiveness and productivity policies not free trade ones.
But aside from all that there's no real reason to stay in the EU other than to be part of one of the world's largest trading markets, to have seamless and frictionless access to nearly 500 million consumers, to enjoy the protections the EU gives all its Member States and the fact that the EU has the clout to stand up (in a way few nations can) to the big bullies in the world - including companies like Amazon and Google.
Why do we have to stop trade? We can agree a new trade deal that is mutually beneficial whilst striking up new deals with other countries too. In terms of standing up to business we can still stand together with other countries, actions such as the expelling of diplomats wasn't confined to the EU, you don't have to be part of a protectionist bloc to stand in arms against mutual foes.
On top of that being part of the EU means being able to live and work in any one of 28 countries, to experience a whole range of cultures, cuisines and climates
This is one of the things I'm sad about but you can't have your cake and eat it, in an ever connected and globalised world the trend is for easier travel and work in the future no matter whether we stay in the EU or not.
a project that has turned a group of nations that were destroying each other a century ago in a hideous war into a team working together that sorts out its differences by sitting round a table and talking rather than by blowing each other up on a battlefield
Personally I think this massively simplifies what has happened. We have become closely linked on trade and energy with these countries through globalisation making it an act of self harm to start wars."

Well, firstly because most of what you are saying there is unfair.
No one is suggesting that we become part of the United States of Europe. At such time such an unlikely possibility might arise we can argue against it from within the EU and if that is really not what UK people want we can put it to a vote and leave.
Why should Europe have to rely on the US for defence? It makes perfect sense to have an EU military force that ultimately could take over from NATO.
You do realise that when people talk about 'free' trade the most likely victims of that are workers and consumers, not to mention the environment.
When the free trade Brexiters hammer out this message what they are aiming for is the destruction of regulations that the EU has in place to protect people like you and me - i.e. consumers and workers, as well as our environment.
The last thing we need is what the Brexiters like to call free trade.
But aside from all that there's no real reason to stay in the EU other than to be part of one of the world's largest trading markets, to have seamless and frictionless access to nearly 500 million consumers, to enjoy the protections the EU gives all its Member States and the fact that the EU has the clout to stand up (in a way few nations can) to the big bullies in the world - including companies like Amazon and Google.
On top of that being part of the EU means being able to live and work in any one of 28 countries, to experience a whole range of cultures, cuisines and climates and to be part of a project that has turned a group of nations that were destroying each other a century ago in a hideous war into a team working together that sorts out its differences by sitting round a table and talking rather than by blowing each other up on a battlefield."

This holds whatever the plan is. No deal is now the only way they get to continue refusing to write anything down. It really is this simple & tragic.",2018-07-22T12:04:00.000+03:00,discussions,US,33,lordfnord23,"It's even more than a theoritical scenario and not just about the precedent.
Single market means - same standards for all products in the EU. So I can book a flight with Ryan Air from germany. Same EASA standards as with a german or a spanish airline.
I can order my uncensored videogames from Austria or UK - I have the same rights as a consumer. I don't have to know their specific laws about warranty.
If I look for stuff on ebay or amazon - there often shops that ship from other EU countries. Doesn't matter to me as consumer.
If there would be one country in the single market that could use lower/different standards - that wouldn't work anymore. These offers would have to come with disclaimers and it might even break EU law - not possible.
Those where simple examples. Now think of a complicated IT product which covers goods, services and capital. Or something from the automotive industry with supply chains covering multiple countries. Software can be complicated enough on its own.
Some parts may come from spain, ireland, austria and the UK. If Uk has cherrypicked standards it would require 100+ pages in the contracts or never work at all, because if shit hits the fan - there are to many laws involved.
And the idea of the EU was - get clother together, have 1 standard not 28+. EU is actually about less bureaucracy, not more. The EU parliament or the EU organization might be to bureaucractic in certain areas. Not saying that it is perfect. But beeing part of the EU means less bureaucracy.
To have ""free"" trade you need the 4 freedoms so trade from Berlin to Barcelona works the same as from Liverpool to Manchester. There are still some exceptions though - but EU ist working on standardizing them.
Free trade agreements on the other hand are quite different and don't really offer ""free"" trade as the single market, although they often get sold sold as this.
They just cover certain products where regulation/standards match and no tariffs are applied on these products. These things usually cover only the big companies/wholesale - there is still paperwork needed, things need to get relabled to match standards/laws and so on.
And regulations/standards have to be accepted - or the products are excluded from the FTA.
So:
It would be a precedent that the EU wants to avoid at all costs - totally against the idea of the EU
Even if you ignore that - it would make trade more complicated for all EU members involved. New laws would be needed.
The UK never got what the single market is and what it does - or they wouldn't have made those proposals. There is no ""partially"" being in the single market. You are in or you are not. That's the definition of the single market. CU may be excluded - still not ideal. But a historic thing and some kind of intermediate solution. Could work with hard borders - but there is Ireland.
Regarding FTAs: I actually think that UK could get better FTAs without the EU. That is just because they don't have to accept so many standards and can be more flexible. True. Don't forget that countries don't sell anything here - it is companies that do. The FTA between the courtries just offers a legal framework for it.
There is a caveat, though.
Let's say UK gets 10+ FTAs for agricultural goods. Some FTAs may allow gene editing, factory farming, chlorine washing, some not. In other FTAs certain pesticides may be not alllowed but in some those are fine. How could UKs industry produce for 10 different standards?
And it is also true for their trade partners. They also do wanna sell to the EU.
So if Australia has a FTA with UK and EU - they wanna cater to one standard not to 2,3 or x different ones. And they probably pick the EU standard - so UK is once again ""ruled"" by the evil EU - but not having a vote on those issues."

- Favorites: 0 The Great Pyramid Mystery Has Finally Been Solved The mystery of Giza has finally been solved: archaeologists uncovered who made the Great Pyramid and how they managed to build one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, is visited by millions of tourists every year. If you have been to Egypt, you probably also have a fun picture of you pointing at the top of the Pyramids or “holding” the Sphinx in your hand. You only have to travel 15 miles from the center of modern Cairo to find yourself thousands of years back in time… in your imagination, even though the pyramids help a lot to make it seem real.
Many scientists, archeologists, and history fans would give anything to travel in time to answer one question. It has been the topic of debate and research for centuries. How was the Great Pyramid built? Were aliens involved in the process? Good news is, you don’t have to wait for time travel to be invented to find out the answer.
TIMESTAMPS The prevailing theory of how the Great Pyramid was built 1:24 More bizarre theories about the Great Pyramid 3:45 One of the theories involved levitation 5:49 The mystery has been solved 6:36
The secret of the Great Pyramid is no longer a mystery to you. You see, it took no aliens, but hard work, limestone, and wooden boats to create one of the wonders of the ancient world. Give this video a “thumbs up” if you liked it, and make sure to subscribe to our channel not to miss any updates.

Our brain is a mysterious thing. We know more about stars than about the things inside our heads! But what we do know about the brain is that it gets less sharp and productive with age. You have a maximum of 20 seconds for each task, but try to answer the questions as fast as possible.
TIMESTAMPS What is the mistake two photos have in common? 0:45 How many holes does the T-shirt have? 1:53 How would you name this tree? 2:40 Can you solve this riddle one in 5 seconds? 3:21 Do you see a hidden baby? 4:26 Which line is longer? 5:12 Can you spot Mike Wazowski? 6:30
SUMMARY If it took you more than 20 seconds to answer each question, or you didn’t manage all the tasks, it means that you have the brain of a mature person. It ‘s hard for you to make your mind see beyond the obvious and you can’t handle change easily. If took you less than 20 seconds, your brain is quite young, and you can approach tasks from different angles. If you answered each question correctly in less than 5 seconds, your brain is very young and flexible! You can notice the tiniest details right away and adapt to new situations easily!

- Favorites: 0 16 FAMOUS LOGOS WITH A HIDDEN MEANING (That We Never Even Noticed) How to design a successful logo? How to build a famous brand for your business? Some of the most well-known logos in the world were purposefully designed to indicate something much more than simple beauty. In fact, it seems that in some cases, every line, curve, and color has meaning behind it.
Adidas, Apple, BMW, Coca-Cola, Toyota… We see these famous brands everywhere but never consider what their logos exactly mean. Curious to know the secret? Watch the 16 famous logos with a hidden meaning you’ve never noticed.
Hyundai 0:33 The letter ’Н’ symbolizes two people – a client and a representative of the company – shaking hands.
Adidas 0:52 The current logo is three stripes at an angle which together form a triangle. This symbolizes a mountain, which in turn represents the challenges that all sportsmen have to overcome day after day.
Apple 1:21 Rob Janoff, the designer who came up with the world-famous Apple company logo, explained his idea in one of his interviews. He bought a bag of apples, placed them in a bowl, and spent time drawing them for a week, trying to break the image down into something simple.
Vaio 1:58 The first two letters of the Vaio logo symbolize an analogue wave. The last two are similar to the numbers 1 and 0 — that is, symbols of a digital signal.
Amazon 2:14 The orange arrow is similar to a smile because the company wants its customers to be satisfied. The arrow is also stretched between the letters ’A’ and ’Z’, in a hint that the company sells absolutely every product you can imagine.
Baskin Robbins 2:40 The pink-colored parts of the “BR” section make up the number 31, which is how many ice cream flavors Baskin Robbins used to famously sell.
Toyota 2:56 The logo represents a stylized image of a needle eye with a thread passing through it. This is a hint at the company’s past – they used to produce weaving machines.
Continental 3:28 Continental, a famous car tire producer, has a logo in which the first two letters depict a car wheel.
Formula 1 3:41 If you look carefully at the white space between the letter ’F’ and the red stripes, you can see the number 1.
Pinterest 3:59 On Pinterest, people collect images they like from across the Internet and ’pin’ them to their online boards. That’s why the image of a pin is hidden in the letter P.
Beats 4:17 Beats, an audio equipment producer based in the USA, uses a logo in which the letter ’B’ looks like headphones on a person’s head.
Toblerone 4:32 The famous chocolate company based in Bern, Switzerland, has a silhouette of a bear in its logo. That’s because Bern is sometimes called a city of bears.
BMW 4:55 The logo is simply a part of the Bavarian flag, the area of Germany where the company originated.
LG 5:18 The logo is a stylized image of a person’s face. According to the company, this represents its aspiration to have human relations with their customers.
Evernote 5:34 The corner of the elephant’s ear is folded over in a similar way how people fold the corner of a page to make notes.
Coca-Cola 5:57 In the space between the letters ’O’ and ’L’, you can see the Danish flag. It’s purely a coincidence. Nevertheless, Coca-Cola has used this as part of its marketing campaigns in the Scandinavian country.

If a mounting screw were to get loose with a standard strap button, the button would rotate and you would not make the mounting any less effective.
With this twist lock arrangement, a loose screw could allow the mechanism to rotate and the device would no longer be as effective.

Also agreed that most of the strap lock devices put the strap way past the body with the exception of the Dunlop recessed model.
I have a Spector that came with these installed; the down side being that you have to counter bore the hole in the bass (big hole so the button can be recessed into the body).

These domains weren’t regged in 1997. In fact, the average first registration date for the above list was 2009.
CryptoWorld (2004), CryptoBank (2008), CryptoRate (2013), BitForex (2013), BitcoinCash (2017), PayEther (2014), GlobalCoin (2007), CryptoTrading (2012)
The Hype Cycle There is a research technology firm called Gartner, that’s developed something called the Hype Cycle . Have you heard of it? It’s a graphic representation of the five phases that an emerging technology (or market) passes through as it matures from seed idea to mass commerce.
There are five major phases in the Hype Cycle: Innovation Trigger – 5G, 4D printing, Smart Dust, Quantum Computing Peak of Inflated Expectations – Smart Robots, Connected Home, Autonomous Vehicles, Blockchain Trough of Disillusionmen t – Augmented Reality, Cannabis, Cryptocurrencies Slope of Enlightenment – Virtual Reality Plateau of Productivity – Speech Recognition/Activation, 3D printing
. In order to cash in perfectly on the next Big Thing there are seven steps to success:
1) Identify the new trend long before it has any significance
2) Recognize it as something that is going to be really big in the future (Technology Trigger)
3) Invest in it when everyone is else saying “you’re nuts”
4) Avoid the temptation to sell during the first wave of media attention (Peak of Inflated Expectations)
5) Keep the faith through implementation failures and public rejection (Trough of Disappointment)
6) Decline lucrative offers during the first wave of public acceptance (Slope of Enlightenment)
7) Sell for top dollar when the next Big Thing becomes an “overnight success” and is part of everyday life (Plateau of Productivity).
There are two good times to invest in emerging technologies or markets. The first is obviously at inception. The second (and the safest IMO) is during the Trough of Disillusionment – after the initial burst of hopeful media hype and widespread attention has faded. What I called in a prior DNgeek blog, the Second Wave .
Is opportunity still knocking?
There are more than two dozen technologies on Gartner’s 2017 version of the Hype Cycle chart. Some they project are more than 10 years away from full commercial implementation. You can check out the chart here .
As a forward looking domainer, there’s a few I have my eye on:
Driverless cars – Exiting the first wave of hype and beginning the long slide into the Trough of Disillusionment due to accidents and fatalities plus competing technologies and implementation issues even for commercial applications.
Crypto-currencies – There are too many historical ups and downs to place crypto’s precise location in the Gartner Hype Cycle model but I would say its beginning to slide towards the Trough of Disillusionment phase where there will be growing skepticism and disappointment after the 2018 BitCoin (BTC) crash, the failure of dozens of crypto Initial Public Offerings (IPO), the banning of BTC in China, Russia, India etc. and the lukewarm results of early adopters like Square.
Even if BTC prices rally this year we are still a long way from widespread use and acceptance. Although common among domainers it’s a misunderstood and fear riddled commodity to the average American and it’s years away from everyday, mass usage (ie Kroger’s, Amazon etc).
Marijuana – I believe it’s in the later stages of the Trough of Disillusionment as cannabis has gradually become legal in seven US states. It’s also been legalized or decriminalized in several developed countries including Australia and Canada. If our government shifts to Democratic leadership in 2020 I think we will quickly see nationwide legalization of medical marijuana and 2-3 years after that legalization of recreational marijuana.
In Summary Big money from big trends is not something that happens overnight and some new technologies die before they make it out of the Trough of Disillusionment. So to be successful we have to step back and look at the macro, five to ten year trends, and be willing to take risks and endure failures.
In any case the timeless formula of buy-low-sell-high remains the operative principle. While foresight, resolve and patience form the bedrock of successful execution.
Remember, not only did guys like Rick Schwartz buy domains in 1997 but they held them for decades and turned down many, many very lucrative offers in between.

Una delle grandi cose della casa intelligente è che è completamente modulare. In qualsiasi momento è possibile aggiungere nuovi dispositivi o provare nuovi software ed essere ancora in grado di controllare la propria casa da remoto. Smart Home: cosa ti serve Anche i produttori di dispositivi ne sono consapevoli. E invece di limitarti a una soluzione o all’altra, molte di queste aziende rendono i loro dispositivi indipendenti dalla piattaforma, permettendoti di utilizzare l’app Home di Apple, Alexa di Amazon o Google Assistant , tra gli altri, per controllare la tua Smart Home . Sì, ci sono pacchetti all-in-one che rendono velocemente la tua casa intelligente, e funzionano bene, ma se questo non ti eccita o ti piace semplicemente l’idea di controllare tutto a casa tua a modo tuo, continua a leggere. In questa guida parleremo della domotica fai-da-te e di come creare un’esperienza unica e modulare per la tua Smart Home . Innanzitutto vediamo cosa ti serve : Una strategia: vuoi che tutte le stanze della tua casa siano intelligenti o solo poche? Cerca di capire come immagini la tua casa intelligente. Sai quali tipi di dispositivi vuoi controllare con la tua voce o telefono? Ci sono un gran numero di dispositivi che puoi controllare dai lucchetti intelligenti, alle luci ed elettrodomestici. Indipendentemente da ciò, individuare le aree della casa che si desidera controllare e trovare i dispositivi che si adattano meglio. Una piattaforma: il numero di opzioni disponibili è infinito. Se sei un fan di Amazon Alexa, scegli i dispositivi che funzionano con quell’assistente. Preferisci l’Assistente Google invece? Scegli i dispositivi che funzionano con il servizio di Google. Una solida rete Wi-Fi: non hai il router wireless più recente e più grande? Va bene. Ma considera di acquistarne uno che è relativamente nuovo e può funzionare con la tecnologia più recente. Le probabilità sono che la tua esperienza di casa intelligente sarà molto migliore se lo fai anche se le reti offerte dalle compagnie operanti in Italia non sono il massimo. Tempo: non c’è un modo semplice per impostare rapidamente la tua casa intelligente. Dovrai collegare i dispositivi, collegarli alla rete e accertarti che funzionino con l’hub di tua scelta. Prenditi del tempo durante il fine settimana o la sera dopo il lavoro per farlo bene. Cosa devi fare per realizzare la tua Smart Home Per andare avanti con una casa intelligente, avrai bisogno di avere un’idea chiara di ciò che vuoi ottenere. In alcuni casi, potresti star bene con il controllo delle luci e poco altro. Ma in altri, potresti voler sapere che il tuo aspirapolvere robot sta pulendo i tuoi piani al piano di sotto mentre stai usando i dispositivi abilitati Alexa per regolare l’illuminazione e l’umore al piano di sopra. Mentre puoi creare un ambiente ibrido per la casa intelligente in cui usi una varietà di hub, come Wink, Amazona Alexa o Apple Home, per controllare i tuoi dispositivi, potrebbe rivelarsi poco pratico dopo un po’. Prova invece tutte le opzioni disponibili sul lato hub e scegli quella che ritieni più comoda. Se sei un utente iPhone, Home potrebbe essere la soluzione migliore. Ma se ti piace davvero essere in grado di gridare i comandi per controllare la tua casa, Alexa di Amazon potrebbe essere la scelta giusta per te. Mettiti comodo con i tuoi hub prima di andare avanti. Dovresti anche essere disposto a scalare la tua casa intelligente con il passare del tempo. Dopotutto, i dispositivi intelligenti non sono economici. E c’è la possibilità che quando inizi a utilizzarne di nuovi, sceglierai di aggiungere più elementi con il passare del tempo. Ma se hai appena iniziato e vuoi una guida rapida per dispositivi Smart Home eccezionali per iniziare il tuo progetto fai-da-te, eccone alcuni: Smart Home: Hub Amazon Echo: un dispositivo molto conveniente con il miglior assistente vocale sul mercato. Non è ancora disponibile in Italia, ma lo sarà entro la fine dell’anno ( Scopri maggiori dettagli qui ) Wink Connected Home Hub: non vuoi essere come tutti gli altri ma vuoi ancora controllare un numero infinito di dispositivi? Wink è ciò che fa per te. ( Compralo qui ) Samsung SmartThings: non è necessario essere proprietari di dispositivi Samsung per utilizzare l’hub SmartThings. Ma ti piacerà sicuramente il suo supporto per un numero infinito di gadget per la casa intelligente. ( Compralo qui ) Google Home: Google Home è la risposta del gigante della ricerca ad Amazon Echo. È un dispositivo di bell’aspetto con un ottimo assistente. È anche molto conveniente. ( Compralo qui ) Termostato Nest: un grande termostato che apprende le tue preferenze e mantiene la temperatura della tua casa perfetta per tutto il giorno. ( Compralo qui ) EcoBee4: un termostato intelligente che misura la temperatura e l’occupazione per mantenere basso il consumo di energia e un livello di comfort elevato. ( Compralo qui ) Luci Philips Hue Starter Kit: è il leader indiscusso delle lampadine intelligenti per la casa. Funziona con ogni hub e funziona bene.

1934–2018
Ross Westwood, age 83, died July 4th, 2018 at Fieldstone Memory Care Hospice.
Ross was born in Provo, Utah, November 23, 1934 to Paul and Marguerite Westwood. He was the youngest of three children, a brother Richard D. Westwood (deceased) and sister Florence Ragland McClure of Selah, Washington.
Ross attended the Maeser School in Provo. He played in every vacant lot, behind the old buildings and walked two blocks to the local movies while his dog Rover waited outside. After the movies, he would invite his friends to have hamburgers and root beer in a mug at the local A and W Root Beer drive in because his parents owned the place and he was “Third Owner”.
Ross later moved to Long Beach, California with his mother and sister. He graduated from Jordan High School in Long Beach. He excelled in school and was student body president. After graduation he worked in Los Angeles for the Doheny Oil Family as their banking and legal courier (long before internet).
He joined the National Guard for two years. He later became a barber specializing in the fad of sideburns. Ross was generous and caring of others. He gave volunteer haircuts to AIDS patients in Los Angeles during the AIDS crises.
He was a 40 year member of AA and sponsored many to sobriety.
Ross became an avid scuba diver. He traveled to Mexico, Honduras and Belize many times. He also traveled several times to Europe, the middle East, South America, Peru and the Amazon River.
In 2005 Ross moved to Yakima, Washington to be closer to his sister and family. He made many new friends and did many site seeing trips in Washington and Canada. He volunteered at Yakima Memorial hospital for nine years.
To know Ross was to love him. He will be missed every day.
He is survived by his sister, Florence McClure of Selah, Washington, nephews: Patrick Ragland of Las Vegas, Nevada, Michael & Linda Ragland of San Clemente, California, and family, Shaun and Gail Ragland family of Yakima, Washington, Barry and Julie Westwood and family of Provo, Utah, Brad and Virle Westwood and family of Provo, Utah. Niece: Kelly and Wayne Looper and family of Oregon and many friends in Southern California.
He is preceded in death by his parents, nephew Michael Westwood (Oregon) and great niece Rachel Ragland (California).
Ross will be inurned at All Souls Cemetery in Long Beach, California in a family plot at a later date.
The family wishes to thank Heart Links Hospice Care and all the staff at Fieldstone Memory Care for all of their support and care of Ross. "

I was overweight and had a pre diabetic blood sugar level. I weighed 81 kg was size 16/18 and am 5 foot 3 inches and 70 yrs of age. Having researched the implications of becoming type 2 diabetic I decided to take action. I bought the book by Dr Michael Moseley The 8 week blood sugar diet ( you can by on Amazon as a book or on kindle very cheaply) as well as the recipe book which goes with it. He cites the research in respect of the diet which he followed and put his own type 2 diabetes in remission. It fully explains which foods will raise your blood sugar and recommends avoiding simple carbohydrates which turn quickly to glucose in your blood . If you are pre diabetic you will be or will be becoming insulin resistant. This means your body produces insulin but can’t make use of it. I won’t go fury into this as he explains it far better and his book is truly inspirational. I followed the diet of 800 cakes a day and then continued on low carb high fat but upped cakes to the amount recommended by this NHS 12 week diet for my then current weight. Within 12 weeks I lost 20 Kilos and I have maintained this weight since last October by following low carb high fat diet. I was also lucky enough to be referred to the NHS diabetes prevention program which confirmed the approach I had taken and advised to continue eating in this way.. my blood sugar levels are now well in the normal range, normal BMI and I’m loving being a neat size 12 At the same time I increased activity walking at least an hour a day, swimming, trying to reduce stress and sleep better all of which have an impact on weight loss Take action now because you can so improve your health by losing weight and choosing carefully what you eat. Can you believe I reached a ripe age of 70 without realising bread, pasta, potatoes, cereals, ( apart from coarse porridge oats) all turn immediately to glucose/ sugar in your blood? We were also taught at the diabetes pre course to be careful as to the quantity of fruit we ate each day and to eat only fruits with a low glycemic index ie berries, apples, pears, plums and to avoid melon, pineapple, and other tropical fruits and fruit juices. Ask your GP to refer you to the Diabetes prevention course if possible? All good wishes"

If you've finally decided its time to invest in a pair of the best everyday socks , then you know that thin, cheap socks can ruin an otherwise perfect day. But, some socks that seem like they would hold up to regular wear don't. So what do you need in a pair you're going to put on your feet every day?
If you're going to wear a sock frequently, you should look for a few important qualities: cushioning and support, breathability, and high-quality construction. Look for a pair of durable nylon, or everyday cotton socks, which are two materials that hold up to longer wear and provide extra comfort.
And, because everyday socks can come in a variety of styles, from crew socks to no-show socks, it’s important to consider what style fits best with your everyday look. For example, if you live a more active lifestyle, you'll want a pair of moisture-wicking socks with anti-bacterial properties. They'll help keep your feet dry and odor-free during your daily workouts. If you have to be on your feet all day, extra cushioning is a must particularly in the arches and heels of your foot.
No matter how you spend your time, your feet get you from place to place, so make sure to thank them with the best everyday socks that will keep you feeling fresh, comfortable, and supported at all times. 1 The Overall Best "

Pretty much everyone travels with tablets and smart phones these days, but there's still something special about writing down your memories in a keepsake journal. The best travel journals are functional, yet fun, and make you want to actually jot down your journey.
There are so many choices out there for journals that picking one can seem overwhelming. Your best option is to choose a journal based on what kind of trip you're taking and who you are as a traveler. While that cute hardcover journal may be great for storing photos, it may not be the best choice if you can't stand printing out photos. Or you may want to reconsider that pricey leather-bound diary if you're going to be be sloshing through marshes and wetlands. And if you know you'll get bored with writing about every last tumbleweed on your drive through the desert, forget about a journal with a ton of blank space.
Your best bet is to choose a journal that fits who you are as a traveler, whether you're an epic list-lover, scrapbooker, doodler, or you're into bullet journaling . Here's a list of the best travel journals for every type of adventure and adventurer out there. 1 The Best Travel Journal "

Es gibt inzwischen eine neuere Version die ich auch hier liegen habe. Das verlinkte Buch ist von 2011 und daher meist schon gebraucht sehr günstig zu bekommen.
Das Buch richtet sich an die letzten 4 Semester des Abiturs und enthält die Themen Alalysis, Lineare Algebra, Analytische Geometrie und Stochastik.
Die Grundlagen vom Gymnasium 10. Klasse und Realschule 11. Klasse sind hier nicht drin. D.h. z.B. die Herleitung der Differenzialrechnung über die h-Methode ist hier nicht enthalten.
Dafür ist ja auch nicht die Qualifikationsphase sondern die Einführungsphase da und das wird in dem Buch zur Einführungsphase auch sehr gut behandelt."

Nintendo’s hit new console, the Switch, is still somewhat limited in the video-watching department. Hulu is the only video app currently available on the console. The good news is that Hulu offers both a great standard streaming service and a new live TV service , so Switch owners aren’t totally left out in the cold when it comes to streaming.
Hulu subscribers can grab the app from the Switch’s app store .
Netflix is also reportedly still considering an app for the Nintendo Switch, though there isn’t anything concrete to report right now. Keep your fingers crossed.
Get the Nintendo Switch The Verdict
If streaming video is something you do a lot of, Xbox consoles are the way to go. But if Sony is more your speed than Microsoft, the PlayStation 4 comes in at a close second.
It’s a close race between the PS4 and Xbox for best streaming console, but in the end Xbox offers more versatility, particularly because it can hook into your cable subscription. The PS4 offers PlayStation Vue, but Xbox has access to Sling TV and other similar live TV services. Nintendo Switch is way behind in the streaming realm, but you can still enjoy some video through Hulu Live with the Switch if you just got to have it for Breath of the Wild .
Modern gaming consoles have turned into powerful computers that can become the centers of our entertainment lives. Whether you’re an Xbox fanatic or a die-hard PlayStation evangelist, you’ve got options when it comes to streaming capability. What side of the console war are you on? Let us know in the comments.

The only stupid people around here are those who don't ask questions/do research before buying. That is a VERY reasonable justification for keeping your OC'ing capacities.
As far as your concerns go:
The NH-D14 ships with two cooling fans on it. I use it personally, and it is the BEST air cooler I've ever laid my hands on. If you don't like its aesthetic, then the Dark Rock Pro 4 from Be Quiet! is also a great alternative.
I would double-check the compatibility with the NH-D14 and your case. I've personally used the D14 in my S340 before with no problems, but there's no harm in checking.
I don't REMEMBER that Windows 10 version shipping with a USB drive, but if you have a spare 8GB+ thumb drive you aren't using, then it would easy to turn it into a Windows install device: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/install-windows-from-a-usb-flash-drive.
The Taichi does indeed ship with Wifi Antennae, at least if you buy it new.
I made a few changes to your build:
Swapped out that RAM, it's quite overpriced. Found a pair of high quality RAM for $50 less, which should make up a significant portion of the Taichi upgrade. Also went for an ADATA SSD vs. Crucial, given that it allows you to upgrade to a 2TB HDD, which is MUCH better GB/$ wise. Also, for $10 more, you could get the S340 elite, a considerably better-looking case imo. Let me know what you think.

In reality, it's about $40 cheaper than the Taichi's price on Amazon if you buy it on Newegg, and $20 cheaper if you get it on Amazon (what I recommend due to their return policy.) Do mind that for the price difference, you'd be missing out on a few useful features. Unlike the Killer model, the Taichi ships with an onboard post code LED, which can be REALLY USEFUL when troubleshooting a PC. Also, it generally has superior overclocking hardware equipped with it. The decision is yours to make."

Generally, you'd be getting better thermals/noise levels with a standard-sized card. Also, 750W may be Overkill, but considering that it's only $9 MORE than a 650W unit, there's really no reason not to get a 750W unit. Alternatively, if you could also get away with a 550W unit which is wayyy better in terms of pricing. Also, I must ask, but why change back from the 2TB HDD? It's quite a bit better value-wise.

Everything worked quite well, except for its internet connectivity. I 'cheaped' out on the motherboard and bought the MSI H310A LGA 1151, which had no integrated wifi chip. No problem, I thought. Went online and bought a highly rated USB wifi adapter from Amazon. Worked fine for browsing, but almost every game was unplayable (consistently got around 400 ping on BF4, and BF1 was even worse). I then decided to try the TP-Link AV1000, which a friend who also recently built a PC uses. So far, I can sometimes get the expected ping in games, but it's often very spotty, and I spend most of the time dealing with an average 750 kb/s download speed and 300+ ping. The odd thing is that the TP Link units show a red light, meaning poor connectivity, which I can't understand, considering my old Alienware X51 (I know. It was a present.) and the numerous other computers and laptops in my household get great connection.
Is it possible that there is something wrong with the PC itself? Should I try a Wifi card that plugs directly into the motherboard? Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.

A Standalone Second Chance Romance Novel By: #1 NY Times Best Selling Author, Vi Keeland
RELEASE DATE: Monday, July 23, 2018
Synopsis : It was just a typical Monday. Until the big boss asked me to make the pitch for a prospective new client. After two years on shaky ground at work because of my screw up, an opportunity to impress the senior partners was just what I needed. Or so I thought… Until I walked into the conference room and collided with the man I was supposed to pitch. My coffee spilled, my files tumbled to the ground, and I almost lost my balance. And that was the good part of my day. Because the gorgeous man crouched down and looking at me like he wanted to eat me alive, was none other than my ex, Gray Westbrook. A man who I’d only just begun to move on from. A man who my heart despised—yet my body obviously still had other ideas about. A man who was as charismatic and confident as he was sexy. Somehow, I managed to make it through my presentation ignoring his intense stare. Although it was impossible to ignore all the dirty things he whispered into my ear right after I was done. But there was no way I was giving him another chance, especially now that he was a client…was there?

But does the Ryzen 5 1600 is fine with the 1080 ti or do I need an upgrade on that too?
For RAM and RAM overclocking, your motherboard apparently supports: 1866/ 2133/ 2400/ 2667(OC)/ 2933(OC)/ 3200(OC)+ Mhz DDR4 RAM. Higher is generally better, but I wouldn't go over 3000-3200mhz like you were already thinking.
I'd recommend a dual channel kit 2x8GB. Since it's so expensive , I'd also recommend looking into https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAS_latency to help you choose the best deal for RAM. A higher clock and higher CAS latency might ""seem"" slightly slower, but the cycle time is faster, and this can compensate for that (so long as it's actually overclocked to that speed). When I was shopping for RAM, I noticed consumers were avoiding and jumping on certain levels of CAS Latency and clock speed, which caused them to vary substantially in price.
Bottlenecking depends on a lot of factors, but your Ryzen 5 1600 is probably going to bottleneck the 1080 Ti. How much...? Depends...
Short term, fine. Long term, you'd probably want something better to get the full use out of the 1080 Ti and your PC in general. Since you have a 1080Ti, I'm guessing you're into a solid performance and a future for your build, even if it costs a bit.
For the best performance, especially to avoid bottlenecking, it's best to get an overclocking capable CPU. You don't have to go overboard on it, but it definitely helps. I'm not sure if you left out the X on your 1600 on purpose or by accident. Your MSI H350 should allow for overclocking and any AM4 socket chip.
Example: http://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/AMD-Ryzen-7-2700-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-2700X/3957vs3958
If you're going AMD, getting something like a Ryzen 7 2700x might be a little more than you need , but should be great, especially for long term and flexibility. It's nice to have a little too much than too little. The Ryzen 7 1800x or 1700x might be on the boundary of bottlenecking, but the 1080 Ti should be fine with them, if not great. I'd recommend if you're shilling cash for a new CPU that you go for a bit more (as you did with the 1080 Ti) for your AM4 socket for only $80 according to Amazon right now. (no need to upgrade MOBO)... although generally you need to make these choices depending on what you're doing and hoping to get out of your computer and how much you can or are willing to spend to achieve it. If you can't afford $320 right now, don't worry about it, but I'd definitely go for if/when you can.
Personal experience: checking the specifications, I had a similar performing processor for a week with the 1080 Ti, and it wasn't being used to it's full potential. The CPU was being maxed out (if not, close) in some cases and I was losing frames because of this. It wasn't horrible, but it was so much better after I upgraded.
I'd personally recommend Intel for gaming, since many games don't use hyper-threading efficiently and many perform best on a stronger individual core basis. However, the decision is yours. That being said, AMD is generally almost as good for gaming and is typically much better as a ""workstation"". Until recently, they're usually much cheaper, too. With AMD, you also get socket upgradability, so you might not have to buy a new expensive motherboard to upgrade (in your case, you don't )
I'd personally recommend the Ryzen 7 2700x for your AMD AM4 socket upgrade path. If you're willing to stray from AMD and pay for [somewhat] better performance with zero upgradability in the future, the i7 8700k is the best choice at the moment. The Ryzen Threadripper 1950x is the best (Intel or otherwise) for high core count price to performance, but you'd need a new motherboard and you'd be wasting most all of the added performance over the 2700x if you only did gaming and general tasks on it, and you'd also need a new MOBO.
Note: Especially if you go into overclocking for GPU and CPU, I'd take a good look at your power supply. Higher clock and memory speeds can influence power draw. Although the ""Founder's"" GTX 1080 Ti recommends a 600W PSU, if you overclock it and/or your CPU (as is nice to do) you may very well need a 750 or 850W PSU. So keep that in mind if you decide to do these things.
Something like this can help: http://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/
Some other calculators seem to add a solid 100-150W seemingly arbitrarily, but then again, it is good to have more than you need with a power supply, because if you don't... well, it's not good for everything connected to it...
These aren't totally accurate or relatable and prices seem to be MSRP and not current market, but they give you a general idea of what I'm talking about and what to expect out of them. These are useful because (especially with AMD vs Intel) core count and clock speed don't always correlate to performance when comparing processors.

Hey Everybody! This particular recipe that I will share today is the same recipe that I posted some weeks ago.. Granola Bars!!!! The only thing different is that instead of placing in freezer, you will place in the oven and they become these healthy breakfast cookies. My husband had this idea of getting the same mixture that I used for my granola bars and just form them into cookies and bake in the oven. Guess what?? It turned out pretty good. I have bought some breakfast cookies in the past, but these are homemade and so easy and good!!!! This a recipe where you can be creative and add raisins, sliced almonds, etc….you can just be creative with these little cookies.
Ingredients: 1/2 cup peanut butter 1/3 cup honey
In a medium-sized bowl pour all ingredients one at a time. Next stir until well blended. Once done stirring, spoon some of mixture into balls and slightly press down to form a nice cookie. Place on a baking sheet and bake for about 8-10 minutes.
***Cookies don’t need to cook, they will just be firm enough and be cookie texture. Place in a jar to make for easy grabbing when on the go for easy breakfast idea!!!***

Kaspersky Lab experts have discovered the distribution of an unusual fraudulent scheme that tricks users into parting with their time and their data, for no return. By creating fake websites for the free generation of gift cards, cybercriminals are able to “sell” users’ data to third party partner sites, to which they redirect victims.
While industry and law enforcement agencies from around the world are busy fighting against cybercrime, criminals themselves are constantly looking for new ways of earning money – other than just malware. Offering something valuable free of charge is always an enticing piece of marketing, and criminals can take advantage of this. Websites that offer customers the option of freely generating gift cards for well-known companies – like iTunes, Google Play, Amazon, or Steam – are nothing new. For example, legitimate apps like Tokenfire and Swagbucks buy card codes from vendors, to then give them to clients as a reward for certain activities. Criminals have apparently recognised the popularity of such websites and have decided to deceive users using a simple algorithm.
When on the fake site, the user is asked to select the gift card he/she wants in order to receive the code. After that, the fraudulent mechanism is set in motion. To get the generated code, however, the user needs to prove that he/she is not a robot. To do this, the user has to follow the suggested link and complete various tasks, the number and type of which are determined by the partner network to which the user is redirected. For example, he/she may be asked to fill in a form, leave a phone number or email address, subscribe to a paid SMS-message, install adware, and so on.
The result is predictable: either victims get tired of doing endless tasks, or they finally get the useless code. The earnings for criminals range from a few cents per every click on a desired link, to several dozen dollars for filling in a form or subscribing to paid services. Thus, the criminals make a profit virtually for nothing, getting paid from the user’s actions on the websites of third-party partners, who, for their part, also benefit by getting access to personal data which can be used for private purposes.
“The success of these new fraud schemes is based on criminals exploiting the drive of users to get something for free. However, at best they will spend hours of personal time doing worthless tasks, and at worst – lose money without receiving anything in return. So, if you want to get your hands on a free gift card, try to earn it on legal and trustworthy sites,”said Lyubov Nikolenko, web content analyst, Kaspersky Lab.
To avoid falling for cybercriminals’ fraudulent schemes and losing personal data, Kaspersky Lab researchers suggest that users follow a few simple rules:
•Remember that there is no such thing as a free lunch and always treat offers that seem too tempting to be true with skepticism. •Check the HTTPS connection and domain name when you open a webpage. This is especially important when you are using websites which contain sensitive data – such as sites for online banking, online shops, email, social media sites etc. •Never share your sensitive data, such as logins and passwords, bank card data etc., with a third party. Official companies will never ask for data like this via email. •Do not spread questionable links among your friends. •Check with the company if it really is giving out gift codes, and whether the site is its official partner. To do this, contact the official support service by reaching out on the official website of the company. • Use a reliable security solution with behavior-based anti-phishing technologies to detect and block spam and phishing attacks, such as Kaspersky Total Security, which blocks fake gift card sites. 114"

The failure on the part of establishment media to defend Julian Assange, who has been trapped in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since 2012, has been denied communication with the outside world since March and appears to be facing imminent expulsion and arrest, is astonishing. The extradition of the publisher—the maniacal goal of the U.S. government—would set a legal precedent that would criminalize any journalistic oversight or investigation of the corporate state. It would turn leaks and whistleblowing into treason. It would shroud in total secrecy the actions of the ruling global elites. If Assange is extradited to the United States and sentenced, The New York Times, The Washington Post and every other media organization, no matter how tepid their coverage of the corporate state, would be subject to the same draconian censorship. Under the precedent set, Donald Trump’s Supreme Court would enthusiastically uphold the arrest and imprisonment of any publisher, editor or reporter in the name of national security.
There are growing signs that the Ecuadorean government of Lenín Moreno is preparing to evict Assange and turn him over to British police. Moreno and his foreign minister, José Valencia, have confirmed they are in negotiations with the British government to “resolve” the fate of Assange. Moreno, who will visit Britain in a few weeks, calls Assange an “inherited problem” and “a stone in the shoe” and has referred to him as a “hacker.” It appears that under a Moreno government Assange is no longer welcome in Ecuador. His only hope now is safe passage to his native Australia or another country willing to give him asylum.
“Ecuador has been looking for a solution to this problem,” Valencia commented on television. “The refuge is not forever, you cannot expect it to last for years without us reviewing this situation, including because this violates the rights of the refugee.”
Moreno’s predecessor as president, Rafael Correa, who granted Assange asylum in the embassy and made him an Ecuadorean citizen last year, warned that Assange’s “days were numbered.” He charged that Moreno—who cut off Assange’s communications the day after Moreno welcomed a delegation from the U.S. Southern Command—would “throw him out of the embassy at the first pressure from the United States.”
Assange, who reportedly is in ill health, took asylum in the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden to answer questions about sexual offense charges . He feared that once in Swedish custody for these charges, which he said were false, he would be extradited to the United States. The Swedish prosecutors’ office ended its “investigation” and extradition request to Britain in May 2017 and did not file sexual offense charges against Assange. But the British government said Assange would nevertheless be arrested and jailed for breaching his bail conditions.
The persecution of Assange is part of a broad assault against anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist news organizations. The ruling elites, who refuse to accept responsibility for profound social inequality or the crimes of empire, have no ideological veneer left to justify their greed, ineptitude and pillage. Global capitalism and its ideological justification, neoliberalism, are discredited as forces for democracy and the equitable distribution of wealth. The corporate-controlled economic and political system is as hated by right-wing populists as it is by the rest of the population. This makes the critics of corporatism and imperialism—journalists, writers, dissidents and intellectuals already pushed to the margins of the media landscape—dangerous and it makes them prime targets. Assange is at the top of the list.
I took part with dozens of others, including Daniel Ellsberg, William Binney , Craig Murray , Peter Van Buren , Slavoj Zizek, George Galloway and Cian Westmoreland , a week ago in a 36-hour international online vigil demanding freedom for the WikiLeaks publisher. The vigil was organized by the New Zealand Internet Party leader Suzie Dawson . It was the third Unity4J vigil since all of Assange’s communication with the outside world was severed by the Ecuadorean authorities and visits with him were suspended in March, part of the increased pressure the United States has brought on the Ecuadorean government. Assange has since March been allowed to meet only with his attorneys and consular officials from the Australian Embassy.
The Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled Friday that those seeking political asylum have the right to take refuge in embassies and diplomatic compounds. The court stated that governments are obliged to provide safe passage out of the country to those granted asylum. The ruling did not name Assange, but it was a powerful rebuke to the British government, which has refused to allow the WikiLeaks co-founder safe passage to the airport.
The ruling elites no longer have a counterargument to their critics. They have resorted to cruder forms of control. These include censorship, slander and character assassination (which in the case of Assange has sadly been successful), blacklisting, financial strangulation, intimidation, imprisonment under the Espionage Act and branding critics and dissidents as agents of a foreign power and purveyors of fake news. The corporate media amplifies these charges, which have no credibility but which become part of the common vernacular through constant repetition. The blacklisting, imprisonment and deportation of tens of thousands of people of conscience during the Red Scares of the 1920s and 1950s are back with a vengeance. It is a New McCarthyism.
Did Russia attempt to influence the election? Undoubtedly. This is what governments do. The United States interfered in 81 elections from 1945 to 2000, according to professor Dov Levin of Carnegie Mellon University. His statistics do not include the numerous coups we orchestrated in countries such as Greece, Iran, Guatemala and Chile or the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba. We indirectly bankrolled the re-election campaign of Russia’s buffoonish Boris Yeltsin to the tune of $2.5 billion.
But did Russia, as the Democratic Party establishment claims, swing the election to Trump? No. Trump is not Vladimir Putin’s puppet. He is part of the wave of right-wing populists, from Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson in Britain to Viktor Orbán in Hungary, who have harnessed the rage and frustration born of an economic and political system dominated by global capitalism and under which the rights and aspirations of working men and women do not matter.
The Democratic Party establishment, like the liberal elites in most of the rest of the industrialized world, would be swept from power in an open political process devoid of corporate money. The party elite, including Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, is a creation of the corporate state. Campaign finance and electoral reform are the last things the party hierarchy intends to champion. It will not call for social and political programs that will alienate its corporate masters. This myopia and naked self-interest may ensure a second term for Donald Trump; it may further empower the lunatic fringe that is loyal to Trump; it may continue to erode the credibility of the political system. But the choice before the Democratic Party elites is clear: political oblivion or enduring the rule of a demagogue. They have chosen the latter. They are not interested in reform. They are determined to silence anyone, like Assange, who exposes the rot within the ruling class.
The Democratic Party establishment benefits from our system of legalized bribery. It benefits from deregulating Wall Street and the fossil fuel industry. It benefits from the endless wars. It benefits from the curtailment of civil liberties, including the right to privacy and due process. It benefits from militarized police. It benefits from austerity programs. It benefits from mass incarceration. It is an enabler of tyranny, not an impediment.
Demagogues like Trump, Farage and Johnson, of course, have no intention of altering the system of corporate pillage. Rather, they accelerate the pillage, which is what happened with the passage of the massive U.S. tax cut for corporations. They divert the public’s anger toward demonized groups such as Muslims, undocumented workers, people of color, liberals, intellectuals, artists, feminists, the LGBT community and the press. The demonized are blamed for the social and economic dysfunction, much as Jews were falsely blamed for Germany’s defeat in World War I and the economic collapse that followed. Corporations such as Goldman Sachs, in the midst of the decay, continue to make a financial killing.
The corporate titans, who often come out of elite universities and are groomed in institutions like Harvard Business School, find these demagogues crude and vulgar. They are embarrassed by their imbecility, megalomania and incompetence. But they endure their presence rather than permit socialists or leftist politicians to impede their profits and divert government spending to social programs and away from weapons manufacturers, the military, private prisons, big banks and hedge funds, the fossil fuel industry, charter schools, private paramilitary forces, private intelligence companies and pet programs designed to allow corporations to cannibalize the state.
The irony is that there was serious meddling in the presidential election, but it did not come from Russia. The Democratic Party, outdoing any of the dirty tricks employed by Richard Nixon, purged hundreds of thousands of primary voters from the rolls, denied those registered as independents the right to vote in primaries, used superdelegates to swing the vote to Hillary Clinton, hijacked the Democratic National Committee to serve the Clinton campaign, controlled the message of media outlets such as MSNBC and The New York Times, stole the Nevada caucus, spent hundreds of millions of dollars of “dark” corporate money on the Clinton campaign and fixed the primary debates. This meddling, which stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders, who probably could have defeated Trump, is unmentioned. The party hierarchy will do nothing to reform its corrupt nominating process.
WikiLeaks exposed much of this corruption when it published tens of thousands of messages hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s email account. The messages brought to light the efforts by the Democratic Party leadership to thwart the nomination of Sanders, and they disclosed Clinton’s close ties with Wall Street, including her lucrative Wall Street speeches. They also raised serious questions about conflicts of interest with the Clinton Foundation and whether Clinton received advance information on primary-debate questions.
The Democratic National Committee, for this reason, is leading the Russia hysteria and the persecution of Assange. It filed a lawsuit that names WikiLeaks and Assange as co-conspirators with Russia and the Trump campaign in an alleged effort to steal the presidential election.
But it is not only Assange and WikiLeaks that are being attacked as Russian pawns. For example, The Washington Post, which has sided with the Democratic Party in the war against Trump, without critical analysis published a report on a blacklist posted by the anonymous website PropOrNot. The blacklist was composed of 199 sites that PropOrNot alleged, with no evidence, “reliably echo Russian propaganda.” More than half of those sites were far-right, conspiracy-driven ones. But about 20 of the sites were major progressive outlets including AlterNet, Black Agenda Report, Democracy Now!, Naked Capitalism, Truthdig, Truthout, CounterPunch and the World Socialist Web Site. PropOrNot, short for Propaganda or Not, accused these sites of disseminating “fake news” on behalf of Russia. The Post’s headline was unequivocal: “Russian propaganda effort helped spread ‘fake news’ during the election, experts say.”
In addition to offering no evidence, PropOrNot never even disclosed who ran the website. Even so, its charge was used to justify the imposition of algorithms by Google, Facebook, Twitter and Amazon to direct traffic away from the targeted sites. These algorithms, or filters, overseen by thousands of “evaluators,” many hired from the military and security and surveillance apparatus, hunt for keywords such as “U.S. military,” “inequality” and “socialism,” along with personal names such as Julian Assange and Laura Poitras . The keywords are known as “impressions.” Before the imposition of the algorithms, a reader could type in the name Julian Assange and be directed to an article on one of the targeted sites. After the algorithms were put in place, these impressions directed readers only to mainstream sites such as The Washington Post. Referral traffic from the impressions at most of the targeted sites has plummeted, often by more than half. This isolation will be compounded by the abolition of net neutrality.
Any news or media outlet that addresses the reality of our failed democracy and exposes the crimes of empire will be targeted. The January 2017 Director of National Intelligence Report spent seven pages on RT America, where I have a show, “On Contact.” The report does not accuse RT America of disseminating Russian propaganda, but it does allege the network exploits divisions within American society by giving airtime to dissidents and critics including whistleblowers, anti-imperialists, anti-capitalists, Black Lives Matter activists, anti-fracking campaigners and the third-party candidates the establishment is seeking to mute.
If the United States had a public broadcasting system free from corporate money or a commercial press that was not under corporate control, these dissident voices would be included in the mainstream discourse. But we don’t. Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky, Malcolm X, Sheldon Wolin, Ralph Nader, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Angela Davis and Edward Said once appeared regularly on public broadcasting. Now critics like these are banned, replaced with vapid courtiers such as columnist David Brooks. RT America was forced to register under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). This act requires Americans who work for a foreign party to register as foreign agents. The FARA registration is part of the broader assault on all independent media, including the effort to silence Assange.
WikiLeak’s publication in 2017 of 8,761 CIA files, known as Vault 7, appeared to be the final indignity. Vault 7 included a description of the cyber tools used by the CIA to hack into computer systems and devices such as smartphones. Former CIA software engineer Joshua Adam Schulte was indicted on charges of violating the Espionage Act by allegedly leaking the documents.
The publication of Vault 7 saw the United States significantly increase its pressure on the Ecuadorean government to isolate and eject Assange from the embassy. Mike Pompeo, then the CIA director, said in response to the leaks that the U.S. government “can no longer allow Assange and his colleagues the latitude to use free speech values against us.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Assange’s arrest was a “priority.”
It is up to us to mobilize to protect Assange. His life is in jeopardy. The Ecuadorean government, violating his fundamental rights, has transformed his asylum into a form of incarceration. By cutting off his access to the internet, it has deprived him of the ability to communicate and follow world events. The aim of this isolation is to pressure Assange out of the embassy so he can be seized by London police, thrown into a British jail and then delivered into the hands of Pompeo, John Bolton and the CIA’s torturer in chief, Gina Haspel.
Assange is a courageous and fearless publisher who is being persecuted for exposing the crimes of the corporate state and imperialism. His defense is the cutting edge of the fight against government suppression of our most important and fundamental democratic rights. The government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia, where Assange was born, must be pressured to provide him with the protection to which he is entitled as a citizen. It must intercede to stop the illegal persecution of the journalist by the British, American and Ecuadorean governments. It must secure his safe return to Australia. If we fail to protect Assange, we fail to protect ourselves. The Truthdig Staff In this article: "

Certainly I know that with Sainsburys you can use them both instore and on the forecourt (though not for online deliveries).
Very easy to top-up and restricted to the main things you want to 'ring-fence' so to speak. You can't use them at the tobacco kiosk so scratchcards/lotto is also taken off the table.
I think I'm right in saying that you can't 'cash-in' these gift cards so you'll remove that temptation.
You can also buy amazon gift cards at most supermarkets which might cover much of your online purchasing needs in a more controlled way (not sure if there may be some way of converting amazon gift card balances into a gambling stake?)
For your 'in person' purchases not covered by the above you could use one of the cards suggested in the thread, just putting the remainder of your spare money on it each pay day.
Best wishes. Originally posted by in my bumble opinion ” Thank you! This actually helps a lot. My ideal scenario would be for there to be one card that covers all of this instead of having to use multiple solutions. But a solution is a solution! So thank you, will look into these methods further."

Content Provided by
Apple unveiled a trio of new iPhones last September and the smallest of the bunch was the iPhone 8 .Just like its big brother, the iPhone 8 Plus , the iPhone 8 sports a glass back, metal frame, and a fragile screen. This diminutive smartphone is going to need some protection. You may also want to add your own special flourish of style. We’re here to help with a look at of some of the best iPhone 8 cases and covers available.
If you’re upgrading from the iPhone 7 , then the good news is that your old case will fit the new iPhone 8. That also means you can check out our roundup of the best iPhone 7 cases for more ideas. You’ll also want to take a look at the best iPhone accessories . If you’re thinking of going big this year, check out our best iPhone X cases guide. Our top picks
After trying out a lot of different iPhone 8 cases, these three are the ones we wholeheartedly recommend. They all have something to offer that you won’t find elsewhere. Speck Presidio Grip Case ($40)
One of our favorite case lines, the Presidio Grip from Speck , offers style and substance. You get two layers of protection to safeguard against drops from up to 10 feet, a scratch-resistant finish, a raised bezel around the screen, and enhanced grip courtesy of the non-slip ridges. The fit is perfect, the button covers are easy to find and not too stiff, and the ridges also prevent any sliding around on surfaces. This case also looks great and comes in a wide range of contrasting and complementary color combinations. There is even a Glitter version now, if you need some sparkle. Of all the different iPhone 8 cases we’ve tried, this is the protective case we use most often. Buy it now from: Nodus Shell Case ($30)
Leather is a comfortable material to hold and it ages gracefully, but you usually have to go for a wallet case if you want a leather finish. Nodus does offer the Access 2 case, which is a stylish wallet, but there’s also the leather Shell case. You get a magnetic mount with it, emblazoned with the elegant octopus Nodus logo, which you can stick on your car dash or another convenient spot. The shell case is minimal with big openings for port and camera access and subtle button covers. It comes in brown, black, teal, or gray and it looks and feels fantastic. If you just want something stylish and lightweight, and you’re prepared to sacrifice some drop protection, then this is a great case. Buy it now from: RhinoShield Mod Case ($32+)
We thought we had seen everything the world of iPhone cases had to offer, but this modular design from RhinoShield offers something truly different. We’re familiar with the CrashGuard bumper, which offers excellent drop protection up to 11 feet in a minimalist design. The Mod case design allows you to add an optional back plate, different colored rims ($5) or buttons ($3), and a camera attachment ($5) that supports wide angle ($60), super wide ($35), macro ($25), and fish-eye ($25) lens attachments. It’s not perfect — the attachments are tiny and assembly is fiddly — but we love the fact you can customize and the lenses produce some really interesting shots you simply wouldn’t be able to get otherwise. Buy it now from: RhinoShield And the rest
The rest of our list are great alternatives if you don’t fancy one of our top three picks. We’ve tried out many of them, but some made the list after being recommended to us, because we tried out the same case with a different phone and liked it, or based on good customer reviews. Casetify Custom Cases ($40+)
What could be better than a fully customized case for your iPhone 8? With Casetify you can upload one of your favorite photos or images, choose a case style that you like, customize the colors, and have them make you a truly personalized, one-of-a-kind iPhone case. There are loads of different options, so you can get everything from a photo of your family on a clear-backed case with an easy-grip protective bumper, to a monogrammed leather wallet case. Buy it now from: Carved Traveler Case ($24+)
If you like natural wood grain, then you can’t go wrong with a case from Carved. Plain wood starts from $24, but the best Carved cases have beautiful designs inlaid, like the Grand Teton pictured, which costs $39. There are also shell inlay designs and prints from some seriously talented artists. The shell case itself is flexible, black rubber with ridged sections to aid grip, tactile button covers, and accurate cutouts. Buy it now from: Nomad Clear Case ($40)
This classy shell case has a typical dual material construction, with a flexible TPE bumper that absorbs impact shock and a tough, transparent polycarbonate back panel. Where it differs from other shell cases is the inclusion of a vegetable tanned Horween leather patch on the back. This patch gives the case a nice feel in hand and it should develop its own patina as it ages. You also benefit from drop protection up to 6 feet with this iPhone 8 case. Buy it now from: LuMee Duo Marble ($70)
LuMee cases not only protect your phone, but also provide studio-quality lighting. The limited edition marble style case comes in three color variants — Black Marble, Pink Quartz, and White Marble. It includes LED lights located on both the front and the back, which means your photos will always be well lit regardless of whether you’re using the front-facing or rear camera. To keep the lights going, each LuMee case comes with a rechargeable battery and charging cord. With its sleek design and siliconeraisededges, it strikes a perfect balance between trendy and durable. Buy it now from: Amazon LuMee Mikol Carrara White Marble Case ($100)
If it’s opulent style you’re after, then this real marble case from Mikol might catch your eye. We tried out the clean Carrara White marble version, but there are options in green, ruby, black, gold, and more. The vein patterns give each case a genuinely unique finish and the marble has been reinforced with fiberglass to reduce the risk of it chipping or shattering. As attractive as this case is, it doesn’t offer a huge amount of protection and it’s expensive. Large cutouts offer easy access to the buttons and the plastic shell curves round your iPhone 8 just enough to snugly hold it, but there is no raised bezel around the screen. It’s really about style, not drop protection, and to that end, Mikol also offers gold engraving of your name or initials for an extra $25. Buy it now from: Mikol Skech Stark Case ($35)
The idea behind the Skech’s new Stark case is to provide real, solid drop protection in a minimal form factor that doesn’t eclipse your iPhone 8. This case promises drop protection for falls of up to eight feet, making it one of the most protective options out there, but it leaves the sides completely open, has large openings for the port and camera, and has a transparent back so you can see Apple’s design. The protection is focused in the corners and along the top and bottom edges, where you need it most. This case is also slim enough that it doesn’t interfere with wireless charging. It comes in black or clear varieties. Buy it now from: Amazon Noreve Tradition B Leather Case ($72+)
Wallet case fans with a love of leather need look no further because the Noreve Tradition B case will tick all of your boxes. This well-padded case covers your iPhone 8 from every angle, with a thin, minimal shell to hold it in place and a solid cover with a magnetic stud closure. You’ll find a couple of card slots inside along with a larger money pocket. The quality is excellent and you can choose from an impressively wide range of different colors and finishes to get the precise look and texture you want. It obviously adds some bulk, but there are accurate openings to ensure you can access every function of your iPhone 8 without having to undress it. Buy it now from: Noreve Caudabe Veil XT Case ($20)
If you dislike chunky cases, but don’t want to risk going completely without protection, then this super-svelte case from Caudabe might tempt you. It’s only 0.35mm thick, and it sports cutouts for the camera, buttons, and port. It’s slightly translucent, with a textured matte finish that’s designed to enhance grip. While it should prevent scratches on the back or frame, there’s no lip to safeguard the screen, and we wouldn’t expect much in the way of drop protection from something this thin — it’s really for minimalists.It comes in blue, red, black, or a kind of frosted finish. Buy it now from: Amazon Caudabe Caseology Skyfall Series Case ($18)
With a knack for creating cases that combine style and protection well, Caseology has been selling boatloads of cases. This one has a clear TPU shell that shows off the back of the iPhone 8, complete with Apple logo. A durable polycarbonate frame, colored to match your iPhone, surrounds the shell for added protection. The cutouts and button covers are good, but what we most appreciate is the solid drop protection and the raised lips around the screen and camera lens. It’s not the slimmest case around, but we think it’s a good-looking option at a reasonable price. Buy it now from: Mous Limitless Shell Case ($45)
Now is the time to pick up one of these very special Limitless cases, due to a substantial discount taking the cost from $85 down to $50 for the iPhone 8 cover. The clever AiroShock system uses tiny air pockets inside the TPU and polycarbonate blend body to achieve a high level of protection for your phone in the event of a fall. Despite this, it only adds 2.3mm to the thickness of your phone — rugged case benefits, without the rugged case. A strong screen protector is included in the package, and there are five different genuine material looks from which to choose. We love the carbon fiber and the very unusual shell finish, and accessories that attach the hidden magnets inside the Limitless case will arrive next year. Buy it now from: Snakehive Vintage Wallet Collection ($30)
What we love about the Snakehive cases most is the super soft, very strokable Nubuck leather that covers the Vintage Collection. Designed in the United Kingdom and handcrafted in Europe, these are beautifully made, attractively styled, and very practical folio cases with space for three credit cards, while your iPhone 8 clips inside a plastic case. The matte Nubuck ages well with time, and just like all the best leather products, it takes on its own look the more you use it. Available in both two-tone, which we like best, and single colors too. Buy it now from: Incipio Esquire Slim Series Case ($25)
If you’re looking for a slim, stylish case to make your cold glass and metal iPhone 8 more comfortable to handle, and a lot easier to grip, then Incipio has you covered. This case boasts a tough polycarbonate core with a bit of flexibility, wrapped in a cotton chambray fabric that comes in black or gray. There are generous openings for easy access to buttons, ports, and the camera, and this svelte case won’t add much to your iPhone’s profile. Buy it now from: Otterbox Symmetry Series Case ($45)
With some of the most protective cases around, you can rely on Otterbox for solid drop protection, but not all of its cases are chunky. The Symmetry Series offers dual-layer drop protection in a fairly slim package that comes in a wide range of fun finishes and colors, some of them new for the iPhone 8. There’s a slight lip to safeguard that screen, flexible button covers, and framed cutouts that won’t interfere with your camera use or cable access. Buy it now from: Silk Base Grip Case ($12)
For all the butter-fingers out there who struggle to keep a hold on the slippery iPhone, this case from Silk could be the answer. It’s quite a slim case, but the outside is textured to provide “Kung Fu grip”. It is very light, but air pockets in the corners help to guard against minor drops and bumps. There are tactile button covers for power and volume, and accurate openings for everything else. It comes in black, gray, blue, and purple. Buy it now from: Tech21 Evo Check Evoke Edition Case ($50)
This clear case shows off your new iPhone 8 design, but adds a touch of style with a floral design, and a whole lot of protection with three layers capable of withstanding falls of up to 10 feet. There are chunky, well-designed button covers that are easy to find without looking and accurate cutouts with plenty of room for third-party cables. With Tech21’s stringent testing , you can be rest assured your iPhone 8 is safe in this case. Buy it now from: Greenwich Chrono Folio Case ($109)
There simply aren’t enough purple cases in the world, so this attractive option from Greenwich Design caught our eye. It’s expensive, but the maker boasts that it’s finished in the world’s finest bull hide leather and, thanks to a hidden carbon fiber lining, can stop a shotgun blast. The cover can also be folded back and used with magnetic mounts. Cutouts offer access to all buttons and ports, and there’s an opening for the camera, too. This case comes with a lifetime guarantee and if you don’t like the damson, there are many other colors to choose from. Buy it now from: Spigen Ultra Hybrid Case ($12)
When you buy a new iPhone 8, there’s a good chance that you want to show it off. This case from Spigen allows you to do just that with a crystal clear or tinted polycarbonate back panel and a TPU frame that comes in clear or a variety of different colors. The button covers are good, the cutouts are spot on, and the bumper provides military grade drop protection to ensure your iPhone 8 isn’t damaged in the event of a minor tumble. Buy it now from: UAG Pylo Series Case ($40)
With reinforced corners and an impact resistant core, this iPhone 8 case can shrug off falls and bumps. You get the same tough protection, oversized button covers, and skid pads as the rest of UAG’s range, but the Pylo cases have a plainer design. This case comes in clear, tinted gray, or tinted red (pictured). It’s quite chunky, but it provides solid protection and enhances grip considerably. Buy it now from: Proporta Ted Baker Shannon Mirror Folio Case ($50)
This folio case comes in muted apricot or gray with a perfectly fitted, electroplated shell to hold your iPhone 8 snug and secure. The cover has a soft, leather-style finish and it opens to reveal a surprise. You might expect to find pockets for credit cards, but instead there’s a mirror. The shell is minimal with the full range of required cutouts. This isn’t a rugged drop protection case, but it does cover all angles, so will serve well if you usually put your iPhone 8 in a bag. The Ted Baker branding appears inside and out. Buy it now from: Amazon Proporta

Meanwhile, I was in San Diego recently, and I spent a couple of hours digging through old census reports and flood maps I can't get electronically for a reasonable price, surrounded by people who were reading or were sleeping, and I'm delighted the people sleeping had somewhere to be that wasn't outside, and where they can read and sign up for classes and workshops, and where there is an entire room and staff dedicated to supporting people who have disabilities.
I also found a mug in the gift shop with a little bunny reading a book, captioned ""Get Lit"" , which I immediately bought for my kids.

They provide TV and movie content to the masses at an affordable rate. Actual video rental services like Blockbuster have gone completely out of business.
Then there’s the rise of digital technology. Technology has turned physical books into collector’s items, effectively eliminating the need for library borrowing services.
Of course, there’s Amazon Books to consider. Amazon have created their own online library that has made it easy for the masses to access both physical and digital copies of books. Amazon Books is a chain of bookstores that does what Amazon originally intended to do; replace the local bookstore. It improves on the bookstore model by adding online searches and coffee shops. Amazon Go basically combines a library with a Starbucks.
The above statements suggest that this guy has not used a public library in decades.
My local public library gives me access to two different movie/media streaming services, and access to a whole pile of digital magazines using my library card (Librarians can correct me on this, but my understanding is that consortiums of public libraries sometimes enter into bulk agreements for these services to harness their combined purchasing power, thereby saving everyone money?)
But anyway, not just physical books, man. Need to borrow an Arduino kit? They can help you with that. Need access to a 3D printer, or you'd like to learn about 3D printing? They've got you covered there, too. And. They run ESL and literacy programs. There's also a little thingy called an interlibrary loan if you're looking for something that's not in your local library's collection. Because libraries are connected and shit, and librarians are literally in the business of HELPING YOU FIND STUFF.
It improves on the bookstore model by adding online searches
He knows people with smartphones can do this on the hoof, right? Even if they're standing in an independent bookstore? That sometimes the joy of reading is contained in things you stumbled on while browsing, or a recommendation you got from a well-read or highly-trained human being specializing in such things (the latter call themselves ""librarians""). No? Thought not.
Or, really, what Foci for Analysis said : What a clueless ashtray.

I visit different libraries often, and when I walk through them frequently see coffee cups right next to laptops (and sometimes people read books there too!).
So, instead of one replacing the other, I think it might be better to think how Starbucks and libraries could partner up. There are some libraries that do run their own cafes, but I think because of Starbucks' ubiquity and convenience, having a presence in libraries would increase library traffic, which is a good thing. I'm reminded how in convenience stores in Taiwan and Japan, they not only provide quick food and coffee, but also have grown to provide some public services like paying bills and sending mail. Because Starbucks is so ubiquitous, maybe they can in turn provide some library services, like having book drops or renewing your library card.
Now, that's just me partly being optimistic and putting aside cynicism temporarily. I know that there are probably good reasons why it made sense for convenience stores to evolve to provide services in those countries, and why there are good reasons why it wouldn't work here in the US. One of them, mentioned above, is that people running businesses frequently seem to have an agenda that the market is always superior and should replace public or government services. So any partnership will likely become a scorpion and frog relationship.
Amazon though, is a whole other bag. I know that some libraries already use Overdrive as their ebook provider, and Overdrive has Amazon deliver books electronically. Other than that, I'm pretty sure Amazon would be happy to replace libraries."

This leads to auto-generated names for the nested stacks and ultimately leads to physical resource ids that exceed the 64 character limit and therefor fail to be created. Example Given a root stack, nested stack and a Lambda function defined within the nested stack using a custom function name the resource is generated by CloudFormation as follows. <root-stack-name>-<nested-stack-logical-id>- -<lambda-function-name>
This quickly leads to the following validation error due to the resource name exceeding 64 characters. Value 'MyStackDev-MyNestedApplicationStack-K87FLFVLYVQJ-MyLambdaFunctionName' at 'functionName' failed to satisfy constraint: Member must have length less than or equal to 64 ( Service: AWSLambda; Status Code: 400; Error Code: InvalidParameterValueException; Request ID: eab56570-8aaa-11e8-9306-c996c69bdf46 )
The only way around this issue is to not use custom resource names in nested stacks at all so the physical ids are fully auto-generated and meet the 64 character limit. <root-stack-name>-<nested-stack-logical-id>-<lambda-logical-id>-
In the case of the Lambda function this leads to the following result. Automatic resource ID too long (70 characters) MyStackDev-MyNestedApplicationStack-MyLambdaFunctionName-1U44TLUZ7OR55
Actual resource ID (64 characters) MyStackDev-MyNestedApplicatio-MyLambdaFunctionName-1U44TLUZ7OR55
Currently, nested stacks do not have a stackName property, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-stack.html . The addition of a name property to AWS::CloudFormation::Stack would allow for more fine grained control over resource names and reduce the risk of the mentioned validation error."

San Diego Comic-Con 2018: Curtis’ iconic performance in the classic horror film gave strength to a man who was attacked by a knife-wielding home invader Jeremy Fuster | July 22, 2018 @ 2:00 PM
Jamie Lee Curtis comforted a man at San Diego Comic-Con who said her performance as Laurie Strode in “Halloween” ended up being a source of strength in a life-or-death situation.
Curtis was in attendance for a Hall H panel discussing her return to the “Halloween” series in this fall’s upcoming sequel from Universal and Blumhouse. During the Q&A, which you can view in the clip above, a fan named Jeffrey Scott said that several years ago, a person wielding a knife broke into his house. Terrified, Scott said he turned to Laurie Strode’s struggle against the Michael Myers as a source of strength.
“I was scared out of my mind, and out of nowhere this thought inside of me went, ‘Well, what would Jamie Lee Curtis do?'” Scott said. “To make a long story short, I’m here today because of the way that you portrayed Laurie Strode. I’m a victor today instead of a victim.” Also Read: 'Halloween' Trailer: Michael Myers Returns and He's Coming for Jamie Lee Curtis (Video)
The emotional retelling stunned Curtis, who came down from the stage to embrace Scott. “These kind of emotions are real,” the actress said.
The upcoming “Halloween” sequel takes place 40 years after the first film, as Michael Myers breaks out of prison and returns to the same town where he and Laurie did battle decades earlier. But while Laurie, who is now a grandmother and a bit of a local legend, is scared for the trick-or-treating kids who suddenly find themselves in danger on Halloween night, this is the day she’s long waited for: the day when she can finish off Michael for good.
“Halloween” opens on October 19. 25 Scariest Horror Movies to Stream on Netflix and Amazon for Halloween (Photos)
If you have a Netflix or Amazon Prime subscription, you'll have no shortage of horror movies within reach at any given moment -- and TheWrap picked the scariest ones sure to induce nightmares.
""Saw"" through ""Saw: The Final Chapter"" (Netflix)
The ""Saw"" movies are best known for being about people getting murdered gruesomely. While there is a fair amount dismemberment, the better part of the series is how each of the movies continually expands the lore and each one captures the powerful dread of being caught in a deadly trap with no way out.
""Starry Eyes"" (Netflix)
The pursuit of fame for one young actress leads her down an extremely dark path in ""Starry Eyes."" One part jealous descent into madness, one part Satanic cult movie, ""Starry Eyes"" is great about subverting expectations and getting its characters embroiled in horrific weirdness.
""13 Cameras"" (Netflix)
Anyone who's ever had a landlord that gave them a weird vibe will relate to ""13 Cameras,"" in which a young couple rents a home from an extremely creepy old man. He's got a voyeuristic bent, with cameras set up throughout the house, which is upsetting enough. That'd be upsetting enough, but it's what the landlord plans to do with all those cameras that makes ""13 Cameras"" so unsettling.
""The Invitation"" (Netflix)
Director Karyn Kusama puts together a dinner party in ""The Invitation"" that's a horror unto itself. The movie finds a couple stuck at what quickly becomes an extremely uncomfortable dinner, but the whole movie is punctuated by characters wondering if they're not just overreacting to their friends' awkward new spiritual convictions. The less you know about this one going in, the better.
""The Last Exorcism"" (Amazon Prime)
There's no end to found footage movies these days, especially on streaming services. But just because a genre draws a lot of weak, low-budget offerings doesn't mean they're all bad, and ""The Last Exorcism"" is the kind of movie that shows the strength of found footage done well. It follows a preacher who admits to scamming people with exorcisms and turns to debunking -- but then brings him into a situation where he's not sure if what he sees is fake or not.
""The Witch"" (Amazon Prime)
Robert Eggers has created one of the most challenging horror films of the year: a slow-burn tale of a Puritan family that is hunted by the occult and their peculiar farm goat, Black Philip. The unveiling of the goat's true identity is one of the most deliciously chilling endings to a movie in recent memory. A24
"" Wes Craven 's New Nightmare"" (Netflix)
This is a Freddy Krueger tale unlike any other. After a decade working on the legendary slasher franchise, Wes Craven turns the camera on himself and the people who made these films with him. ""New Nightmare"" is an exploration of how horror movies affect their creators, as well as a deconstruction of Freddy Krueger's shift from Craven's original vision as the ultimate nightmare to a goofy comic relief figure whose kills the audience had come to root for. New Line Cinema
""Children of the Corn"" (Netflix)
This list wouldn't be complete without creepy children, and ""Children of the Corn"" is arguably the greatest creepy children movie ever. Sorry, Damien, but you've got nothing on these kids who murdered all the adults in town and now rule it for themselves.
""An American Werewolf In London"" (Amazon Prime)
Even 35 years later, John Landis' classic is still praised for having the most magnificent werewolf transformation scene of all time. Along with leaving you grossed out and terrified, ""American Werewolf"" will make you wonder ""how did they do that?""
""Hellraiser"" (Netflix)
One of the best, and most neglected, horror story tropes is that of monsters from actual Hell who are looking to take you home with them to royally f--- you up for all eternity. It's a whole lot scarier than just the threat of being murdered.
""The Babadook"" (Netflix)
You'll be hard-pressed to find a horror film as thoughtful and intelligent as this one. ""The Babadook"" is a parable about how grief and loss can consume those who suffer through it, and despite all the coaxing and cajoling you'll get from friends, you'll never be able to ""just let go."" ""The Babadook"" shows the process of coming to terms with loss and preparing to spend the rest of your life living with that pain, even when it's scarred over. This is proof that horror can move you as well as scare you. IFC
""Hostel Part II"" (Amazon Prime)
The adventures of unwitting college kids getting kidnapped so rich people can torture and murder them continues. But this underrated gem of a sequel transcends the ""torture porn"" label that accurately describes its predecessor. With female leads this time, ""Hostel pt. II"" has a really nice vindictive streak. It's so good.
""Hated In The Nation"" from ""Black Mirror"" (Netflix)
Yeah, it's a TV episode rather than a movie, but at 89 minutes, the Season 3 finale of Charlie Brooker's smash hit sci-fi horror series might as well be a movie. ""Hated In The Nation"" explores how Twitter has transformed mob rule into an endless stream of harassment; and in the world this story weaves, that online hatred can literally kill. And also there are killer robot bees.
""It Follows"" (Netflix)
Director David Robert Mitchell captures the mundane safety of the Michigan suburbs and how it can all go sideways with “It Follows.” There are some underlying themes of sexual assault and believing women that are always poignant, but “It Follows” is mostly about an unstoppable monster that could look like anyone, and it’s creepy.
""The Void"" (Netflix)
“The Void” is a Lovecraft-esque nightmare with some horrifying mutant creatures and spooky cultists. It captures the cosmic terror atmosphere of the material that inspires it, but better still, it uses some solid practical effects to put together some haunting monsters for its characters — trapped in a hospital as supernatural things go on all around them — to deal with.
""Green Room"" (Amazon)
Never one to shy away from brutality and gore, writer and director Jeremy Saulnier's “Green Room” both, and it's terrifying. The story follows a young punk band who find themselves playing at a skinhead bar — and then witness a murder. For the rest of the movie, they struggle to survive Neo-Nazis who want to murder them. It's one of Anton Yelchin's last films, and he's phenomenal in it.
""Honeymoon"" (Netflix)
The feature film debut of director Leigh Janiak didn't make a ton of money, but it's secretly a strong, spooky horror movie about the people you think you know best. A recently married couple head out to a cabin in a small town for their honeymoon. Then the evil stuff starts happening, as husband Paul discovers wife Bea wandering and disoriented in the woods. Things go from bad to worse as Bea becomes more distant and weirder.
""Gerald's Game"" (Netflix)
The recently released Stephen King adaptation is really great at subverting expectations, and gets a lot of scary mileage out of a relatively simple but freaky concept. It’s also super easy to imagine a similar (although possibly less sexy) situation going awry makes the movie all the creepier.
""Absentia"" (Amazon)
""Absentia"" disarms with its early moments. It's a fairly low-budget movie about a woman moving on after years of looking for her disappeared husband. Then he suddenly reappears, and everything takes a supernatural turn. The movie was originally funded on Kickstarter, and despite its humble beginnings, it has some great, spooky ideas at play.
""The Shrine"" (Netflix)
A trip to an Eastern European country takes a turn for the disastrous as a group of journalists try to find out to an American traveler. With cult-member locals and possibly even demons to contend with, it makes you think you might want to at least learn the language of wherever you’re headed when you go overseas.
""The Devil's Candy"" (Netflix)
A family of heavy metal fans move to their dream house in Texas, but it’s not all great. The place is apparently haunted, and in true “Amityville Horror” fashion, dad Jesse finds himself under some evil influence. But also there’s a huge scary, murdery neighbor to deal with.
"" Train to Busan"" (Netflix)
There are tons of zombie movies on Netflix at this point, but “Train to Busan” does a pretty great job of differentiating itself. The story follows characters as they struggle to survive an infection moving through a train as the train barrels through a South Korea quickly slipping into apocalypse.
""Hush"" (Netflix)
Home invasion slasher flick ""Hush"" gives a little twist to a tried-and-true formula: Its protagonist, Maddie, is deaf. That adds a lot to the tension of a scary masked guy trying to break into her house, as Maddie has to fight to survive his attacks with a different set of senses than your usual slasher victim. ""Hush"" captures a lot of suspense this way and is pretty good about creating situations that give a fresh spin to a fairly full horror subgenre.
""The Monster"" (Amazon)
""The Monster"" follows a less-than-great young mom and her daughter as they find themselves trapped in the woods when their car breaks down. When they call for help, they discover something big and hungry waiting for them in the darkness. Most of the movie takes place with the pair trapped in the car, and it does some pretty good work exploring its characters as they try to figure out how they'll survive the creature waiting for them.
""V/H/S/2"" (Netflix)
There are several ""V/H/S"" horror anthologies out there at this point, but the second one remains the strongest. With shorts produced by multiple directors, ""V/H/S 2"" is more of a scary movie buffet, and it has some really high-quality offerings. The short ""Safe Haven"" is a standout, and the movie's worth checking out just for that one. Previous Slide 1 of 26

And it's now spread over the whole country. It's cost us a lot of money it's cost us a lot of effort and it'll cost us a lot of effort in the future. I would say the momentum is gaining gaining gaining new people came in as value investors. You got something else that Amazon venture capital investment and I don't apologize because I'm sharing the same myself. And it looks like it may work if it does work it it'll be a long slow grind but it could be a way bigger business. That business editor what we have now across the lot we have more software revenues now than we have on traditional business and the fact that it's costing us lot of money does not bother me a little. I think a lot like easily sometimes it's Longo's as long as we're taking territory. Having said that the director there's no point in being rich and you don't use it to compete effectively. So it a very good question. But I regard it as a total fluke. It isn't what I've done in life. You argue that Berkshire Hathaway is once created the business from scratch. It's where the fortune which is the reinsurance department and it's something that you know we've done personally. We weren't once there we may eventually get one of a dozen here if we succeed. It's not only good for the shareholders it's good for the world. This whole system the government uses is very inefficient it needs a lot of automation and software is very complicated and the service is complicated and very difficult.
One of the reasons the opportunity was available is it is very impossible difficult people like Microsoft they hate this kind of it's too hard. They have their own way of shooting fish in a barrel. I kind of like it so hard because we win will be hard to take away that. That's probably the best question you ever ask because when it's very important effects a whole through the company earlier said that one of the most important things you've picked up from Darwin was the value of objectivity by forcing yourself to search for disconfirming evidence. What important thing did you pick up from Einstein that you didn't know before. Well I didn't know about relativity. I thought I wasn't smart enough to figure it out for myself. And of course we look for disconfirming evidence. One of the directors said very simply we should make a list of everything that irritates a customer and that we should eliminate those defects one by one. Of course that is the way to compete in a service business of continuing analysis of it. One of the reasons we bought the local company in Logan Utah is that we like the service ethos of the place and there are members of Congress are there McCallum's. God damn I wish OlsonPa. Scott damn was only just one.

New York: Wall Street stocks fell Thursday following a mixed round of earnings, with investors battering companies that posted disappointing results.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.5 percent at 25,064.50.
The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.3 percent to 2,804.49, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.4 percent to 7,825.30.
Investors have been bullish on second-quarter results amid projections that earnings overall could jump 20 percent from the year-ago levels following the US tax reform.
Stocks have mostly risen during earnings season but “investors just wanted to digest some of the gains,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
Large banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America fell more than one percent after rising earlier in the week on strong results.
Among other losers on Thursday, eBay sank 10.1 percent after it lowered its full-year sales forecast, exacerbating worries the online marketplace is losing momentum to Amazon.
Alcoa plummeted 13.4 percent as it cut its full-year profit forecast due in part to increased costs from US tariffs on aluminum imports.
Dow members American Express and Travelers also fell after earnings.
But IBM jumped 3.3 percent after reporting a 3.1 percent increase in second-quarter profits to $2.4 billion on higher sales. Revenues rose in key growth businesses such as cloud computing and analytics.
Comcast gained 2.6 percent as it said it was pulling out of the bidding war with Walt Disney for the film and television operations of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and would focus on acquiring the European pay TV operator Sky.
Fox lost 0.3 percent while Disney gained 1.3 percent.

Roland Quandt Samsung is reportedly planning to release a two-in-one charger for its smartphones and the upcoming Galaxy Watch. Packaging for the Wireless Charger Duo has leaked ahead of Samsungâ€™s Unpacked press conference, which will be held at Barclays Center on August 9th.
The Wireless Charger Duo box reveals that itâ€™s capable of charging either two Qi-compatible phones simultaneously or one phone and the Galaxy Watch. Both placement areas support fast wireless charging. The upcoming Note 9 is rumored to feature a 4,000mAh battery, and Samsung has registered a new wireless charge r that could improve upon the already-fast wireless recharge capabilities of recent Galaxy smartphones. Itâ€™s not yet clear whether the Wireless Charger Duo will be capable of that higher output.
After early rumors hinted at Samsung making a return to Googleâ€™s Wear OS with its next smartwatch, thatâ€™s looking less and less likely. The Galaxy Watch is believed to again run the companyâ€™s own Tizen software.
The Wireless Charger Duo comes as Apple continues working away on its AirPower mat, which was first announced at last Septemberâ€™s iPhone event. While two-way chargers are relatively common, Apple has said that AirPower will simultaneously charge three devices â€"" such as an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. In June, Bloomberg reported that Apple has faced â€œa series of technical hurdlesâ€ during the course of AirPowerâ€™s development, such as making sure the charging mat doesnâ€™t overheat and working with its â€œcomplexâ€ circuitry.
Aga in, Samsungâ€™s Wireless Charger Duo just covers two devices at once. The companyâ€™s Icon X earbuds donâ€™t support wireless charging as of yet. But if youâ€™re planning to pick up both the Note 9 and Galaxy Watch, it might prove a convenient (albeit probably very pricey) accessory.

I use LinkedIn to get in touch with people for stories and interviews, but I don’t like using the built in messaging service (InMail). I’d rather email the person, but LinkedIn doesn’t provide email addresses (they want you to do everything in the confines of their walled garden). I use a Chrome extension called ContactOut which provides a pop-up with the person’s email address. It hasn’t failed me yet. — MF

Who I am reading
When people ask me who I am paying attention to these days, my surprise answer is: VCs who write. I have little interest in finance, investments, or even in business in general, but today’s VCs have the right combination of idealized high overview and grounded detailed realism. I am following Benedict Evans , Fred Wilson , Brad Feld , Marc Andreessen , Chris Dixon , Paul Graham for the big views. — KK

Better than ever hiking app
I’ve had the AllTrails app for 4+ years now, but I’ve been using it more often since I moved from SF to San Jose. I needed to find local hiking routes and I love that I’m able to filter by elevation and distance, and route type (e.g., loop, out & back, point to point). Since it’s been around for a while now, there are a lot of reviews for each hike and that’s really helpful because I like to avoid any trails where I might run into a mountain cat. — CD

I'm building a new gaming PC, how does this look to you guys. I was thinking 1080p gaming. Motherboard choice is due to me requiring a WiFi adapter and I already have the 850 P2
Faster memory, DDR4 3000 or better and a better quality and larger HD, 128 GB is too small and it's old NVME standard, very slow for NVME.
So I changed out the memory and SSD to an SATA Samsung 250GB.

The S&P 500 finished flat, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished a tick higher (+0.2%), and the Nasdaq Composite finished a tick lower (-0.1%). The small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed, rallying 0.6%. President Trump capped a week-long trip to Europe on Monday by meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland. The leaders met for roughly four hours, discussing a wide range of topics, including arms control, the future of Syria, and, of course, Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, which Mr. Putin again denied. Mr. Trump faced criticism for appearing to reject his own intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia meddled in the election in favor of Mr. Putin’s plea of innocence. President Trump later clarified his remarks, replacing the word would with wouldn’t in the following statement referring to Russian interference: “I don’t see any reason why it would be [Russia].” On to U.S.-China trade relations, NEC Director Larry Kudlow said on Wednesday that he believes some lower-ranking Chinese officials would like to reach a trade deal, but Chinese President Xi is refusing to compromise. China’s foreign ministry responded to Mr. Kudlow’s comment, calling it “shocking” and “bogus.” Back to Mr. Trump, the president did an exclusive interview with CNBC on Thursday in which he criticized the Fed, saying he’s “not thrilled” about interest rate hikes, and said he is willing to slap tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese goods – virtually every Chinese product coming into the U.S. – if necessary. Mr. Trump also commented on the strengthening dollar, saying it puts the U.S. at a disadvantage. The president followed up that interview with a tweet on Friday, saying “China, the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the U.S. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day – taking away our big competitive edge…Tightening now hurts all that we have done.” Mr. Trump’s comments on the Fed were particularly controversial as presidents typically refrain from speaking on monetary policy in an effort to protect the Fed’s independence. The White House issued a follow-up statement after the CNBC clip aired on Thursday, clarifying that Mr. Trump respects the Fed’s independence. On a separate – but related – note, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave Congress his semiannual update on the economy and monetary policy, speaking before both the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. Powell’s testimony provided no new information; he simply reinforced the view that improving economic conditions should allow the Fed to continue hiking rates gradually. Whew. With all of that in mind, let’s turn away from Washington and towards this week’s trading on Wall Street. The second quarter earnings season heated up this week with several influential names reporting their latest results. Netflix (NFLX) dropped sharply on Tuesday – although shares did rebound notably intraday- after the streaming media company missed subscriber growth estimates. Ahead of earnings, Netflix was up more than 100% on the year. Fellow tech names Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM), and eBay (EBAY) also reported their quarterly results this week. Microsoft and IBM rallied after beating earnings estimates, but eBay tumbled after reporting below-consensus results. The top-weighted technology sector finished the week with a gain of 0.1%, extending its yearly advance to 15.4%. Several financial giants also reported earnings this week, including Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS), all of which topped estimates. The positive results helped the heavily-weighted financial sector climb 2.2% and finish atop the week’s sector standings. In other corporate news, Comcast (CMSA) said it will not counter Disney’s (DIS) offer for 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA) entertainment assets, and Amazon (AMZN) held its annual Prime Day, saying the 36-hour special was its biggest shopping event ever – even despite having to deal with some technical glitches. Energy was the worst-performing sector this week, losing 1.9%, as crude oil extended last week’s tumble; WTI crude futures dropped 3.9% to $68.23/bbl and are now 8.0% below the nearly three-and-a-half year high they’ve touched several times this month. Fears that the U.S. may give some countries waivers to continue buying oil from Iran was one of several factors weighing on the commodity. Dow Jones Industrial Average +1.4% YTD ( up for the week +0.2% ) Nasdaq Composite +13.3% YTD ( down for the week -0.1% ) S&P 500 +4.8% YTD ( unchanged for the week ) Russell 2000 +10.5% YTD ( up for the week +0.6% )
(Excerpts from Briefing.com) Friday: Flat Week Ends With Flat Friday Session Stocks finished a range-bound Friday session little changed, shrugging off potentially rattling comments from President Trump. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both lost 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished unchanged. Friday’s stumble left the S&P 500 flat for the week. In a CNBC interview aired on Friday morning, President Trump said he is ready to put tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese goods — approximately the entire amount of goods shipped to the U.S. from China in 2017. Later, in a tweet, the president doubled down on his criticism of the Fed, saying rate hikes hurt what his administration has accomplished, and reiterated his concern over a strengthening dollar. The U.S. Dollar Index tumbled 0.8% to 94.20 in response to the president’s comments, retreating from a 12-month high. Microsoft (MSFT) headlined the earnings front, climbing 1.8% on the back of a better-than-expected quarterly report. Its outperformance helped the top-weighted technology sector get off to a good start – the group was up as much as 0.7% – but the bullish momentum faded as the day wore on. The tech group finished higher by 0.1%. Elsewhere on the earnings front, Honeywell (HON) and Capital One (COF) also rallied on better-than-expected results, adding 3.8% and 2.0%, respectively. However, General Electric (GE) declined 4.4% despite beating estimates, and Skechers (SKX) plunged 21.0% after missing estimates and issuing disappointing guidance. The consumer staples sector (+0.6%) was the top-performing group on Friday, and financials (+0.2%) eked out a slim victory. Meanwhile, eight of the eleven sectors finished in the red, with utilities (-0.8%) and real estate (-0.9%) being the weakest performers. No other space lost more than 0.5%. In the bond market, Treasuries sold off in a curve-steepening trade, with the 2-yr yield climbing one basis point to 2.60% and the 10-yr yield climbing five basis points to 2.90%. Some analysts saw the increased 2-10 spread as a sign that investors believe President Trump’s criticism of the Fed could slow down the pace of rate hikes. The S&P 500 tested the 2800 level several times on Friday, but it held through each attempt, with the low of the day coming in at 2800.01. Investors did not receive any economic data on Friday. Looking ahead, Existing Home Sales for June is the lone release on Monday.
Market Internals – Friday 20 June Lower than average volume (NYSE 823 mln vs avg. of 827 mln; Nasdaq 1774 mln vs avg. of 1978 mln) Decliners outpacing advancers (NYSE 1374/1547, NASDAQ 1393/1553) New highs outpacing new lows (NYSE 90/32, NASDAQ 130/39).
Dollar: Dollar Index Nears 50-Day Average The U.S. Dollar Index was down 0.7% at 94.52 , turning negative for the week. The Dollar Index edged higher at the start of the Thursday’s overnight session, but the slight strength faded by the start of European trade. The Index faced another downdraft in Friday morning’s trade, shortly after President Trump criticized rising rates once again, and voiced his displeasure with recent dollar strength. The Dollar Index, which now hovers just above its 50-day moving average (94.27), has lost 0.2% for the week after being up 1.0% for the week on Thursday morning. Bonds: Longer Tenors Pull Back U.S. Treasuries ended the week on a lower note with longer tenors showing relative weakness after a prolonged stretch of outperformance. Longer-dated Treasuries started the day with modest losses and continued sliding in steady fashion into the afternoon while shorter tenors climbed in the early going, but could not avoid a lower finish. This morning featured the airing of a CNBC interview, in which President Trump voiced his displeasure with rising rates and threatened to impose tariffs on all imports from China. Mr. Trump later took to Twitter, calling out China, the European Union, and “others” for “manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower while the U.S. is raising rates.” St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who expressed concern with the pace of rate hikes three weeks ago, said President Trump is just one more voice in the interest-rate debate and that the Fed will not be swayed by public criticism from the president. Today’s selling pressure on the long end lifted the 30-yr yield to a three-week high while the slope of the yield curve saw some steepening after more than a month of near-daily flattening . The 2s10s spread widened by four basis points to 30 bps while the 2s30s spread expanded by five basis points to 43 bps. 2-y r: up 1bps to 2.60% from 2.59% from the previous week 5-yr: up 4bps to 2.77% from 2.73% 10-yr: up 7bps at 2.90% from 2.83% 30-yr: up 10bps to 3.03% from 2.93% The yield curve steepened as the longer maturities gained against the shorter maturities’ yields. The spread between the 5s10s widened to 13bps from 10bps the previous week while the 10s30s widened to 13bps from 10bps the previous week. Commodities The Bloomberg Commodity Index settled at 83.68, lower than 83.83 the previous week as energy and metals continue their seasonal weakness. WTI oil fell below $67/barrel but closes above $68.00 for the week. The spread between WTI and Brent widened for a second week to $4.81 from $4.30 the previous week.

I've seemed to have finally escaped that food rut and have some easy & delicious recipes coming your way! One of which is this super simple yogurt. This venture into yogurt-making started with Emi being sensitive to dairy.. she has developed some serious eczema that goes away when we reduce or eliminate dairy. Back in my Pinterest boards I had saved a cold-start method that involved an Instant Pot - but my Instant Pot doesn't have that setting. Many of the other recipes require heating and cooling the milk to certain temperatures and that seemed too involved.. I don't have time to babysit yogurt when I have a fearless toddler to keep an eye on.. I needed it to be as simple as possible. Back to the drawing board with the cold start yogurt method. Over on Amazon I found a highly rated and inexpensive yogurt maker - a machine that keeps jars of yogurt within the correct temperature range for the probiotics to happily multiply. So if your instant pot has a yogurt setting, feel free to use that! If not, get yourself a yogurt maker! Other things you'll need: Ultra-Pasturized Milk - we love the Fairlife brand - it's lactose free, lower sugar and higher protein. It was also the first one I tried. It worked. Why fix something that isn’t broken? I’m sticking with Fairlife, but you can use Organic Valley or Horizon, just check the labels. A Starter/Live Cultures - Similar to how sourdough bread needs a starter, so does your yogurt. You can purchase freeze-dried starter, but the best (and most cost-effective) way in my opinion would be with yogurt. We used Fage, plain yogurt - but you can also use Chobani, Siggi, Dannon & Yoplait. Once you’ve made your first batch of yogurt you can use your homemade yogurt as your starter. Freeze some yogurt in an ice cube tray, and then use a couple thawed cubes in your next batch. Cold Start Yogurt 1 gallon ultra pasteurized milk like Fairlife brand - let come to room temperature. 2 tbsp plain yogurt with live cultures like Fage brand Instructions 1. In a large metal or glass mixing bowl (or Instant Pot/IP) combine yogurt ingredients. Whisk until well combined. Evenly distribute into glass yogurt jars - if using Yogurt Maker. 2. If using an Instant Pot, use the glass lid or make sure vent is open so pressure doesn't build. Press the yogurt setting, incubate for 8-10 hours. If using a Yogurt maker, replace cover and set timer. The amount of fat content in your milk can affect the time as well as how soft or set you'd like your yogurt. Using the longer time frame for ""greek-style"" yogurt. Whole Milk: 8-9 hours 2% milk: 10-11 hours Skim Milk: 12-13 hours 3. When done, without stirring, transfer yogurt jars with lids (or inner pot of IP with lid) to a refrigerator and chill for at least 3 hours (IP: 8 hours) 4. Serve your cold start yogurt plain or with desired toppings - We like to add in a little vanilla extract, raw honey, jams/jellies or fresh fruit. This will keep in refrigerator for 7 days. This yogurt is thick, creamy and delicious and a FRACTION of the calories and sugar store bought yogurt has. We've been making a batch weekly and love it! I plan to play around with making a coconut milk yogurt, however I'm not sure I can do that cold-start. Soon as I have that down, I'll share that too! When you make this, I'd love to hear how it turns out! Come back and share below! Share This Story"

~~ PRIZE ~~
Two schools: One of magic and science, the other focused on military excellence. A dangerous undercurrent flows within both…dark and deadly.
Everson is brilliant, ingenious, and yet, he feels broken. Cursed with a disability, he dreams of nothing more than being useful. Quinn is bold, defiant, and will do anything to protect her brother. When Everson is accepted to an academy of magic and engineering, Quinn enters a school of combat in order to join him in Fallbrandt. However, things within the fabled institutions are not what they seem. Beneath a mantra of good intentions and the objective of a better future, spies and conspiracies lurk.
Quinn finds herself embroiled in a struggle she doesn’t understand, one that has dire consequences as her training shifts from difficult to deadly. Her relentless determination and will to survive might be enough, if she only knew whom she could trust.
Within the other school, Everson learns about a dangerous power known as Chaos. Unable to wield this magic, he instead focuses on melding Chaos with science, dreaming of inventions that would shape the future. Perceptive, imaginative, and curious, his endeavors lead him to a discovery that could change the world…and then he discovers the truth.
(Amazon reviewer) Shelly in Sunny San Diego rated it . The characters and action scenes are particularly written, the entire book is well written. Glad this is a series, as I look forward to more adventures with Quinn and Everson and friends. Wonderful is this tale that makes you feel a part of the story, not simply and observer. Try this book and join in the fun! (Amazon revie wer) Roger & Jean Fauble rated it . My third read from author Jeffrey L. Kohanek was amazing, a 294-page thrill-a-minute read, even better than the first two books by him I read! I’ll be reading more from him as soon as I get more! (Goodreads reviewer) LooseBoots rated it . I am always apprehensive when I read a new authors book. With this one I need have no qualms. Brilliant read. Brother and sister join an academy, both schools linked . One for engineering and one warrior. Both have an interesting journey that culminates in an exciting climax that hints at further wondrous adventures. Full of magic, mayhem but all in all it’s an enthralling read. Highly recommended. (Goodreads reviewer) Angie Watson rated it . I loved this book. The concept of magic, engineering and military skills, all having a strong place hooked me from the start. The style of the narrative was interesting, mixing the memories of Quiin & Everson with their interrogations. I don’t want to give any spoilers, so won’t go into details, but if you like epic fantasy, you’ll love this book. I highly recommend it."

I tried few hours to fix the curl library and just gave up 2- then I went ahead and reinstall everything using an Ubuntu AMI (instead of the Amazon Linux AMI). The whole install went much smoother and was able to install librtmp-dev and run the Kinesis install scrip without error 3- I set all the environment variable mentioned (PATH, GST_PLUGIN_PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PKG_CONFIG) 4- And after all that when trying to launch ""gst-launch-1.0 -v rtmpsrc ..."", it gives me an error saying: WARNING: erroneous pipeline: no element ""rtmpsrc""
So although I installed the librtmp package was not recognizing rtmpsrc as a plugin 5- Although not clear in your explanation, I figured I had to install the plugin inside gstreamer, but after hours of searching I'm still not clear on how to do so. Reading: https://github.com/GStreamer/gst-plugins-bad/tree/master/ext/rtmp I tried to uninstall librtmp-dev, download the librtmp source, make it as mentioned, then tried to reinstall the rtmp plugin inside kinesis-video-native-build/downloads/gst-plugins-bad-1.12.3/ext/rtmp, lost it 6- I am now back reinstalling everyhting .... But the worse of all is that even if I manage to get the rtmpsrc plugin to work inside GStreamer, I have the feeling it will still not work and answer my question. Because you mention launching ./gst-launch-1.0 -v rtmpsrc name=rtmpsrc blocksize=1024 do-timestamp= true location= ""rtmp://hostrunningrtmp:1935/vod2/teststream.mp4""
The problem is video conferencing servers are not streaming using RTMP! When capable of, they will push the media using RTMP to the URL of the RTMP server they will be given. Those servers do not have an RTMP port open to which an RTMP client can connect using the advertised URL and start pulling the media. And looking at the command you send me, this is what GStreamer seem to try to do. This also seems to be confirmed by the explanations at https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-bad/html/gst-plugins-bad-plugins-rtmpsrc.html +italics+This plugin reads data from a local or remote location specified by an URI. This location can be specified using any protocol supported by the RTMP library, i.e. rtmp, rtmpt, rtmps, rtmpe, rtmfp, rtmpte and rtmpts. italics Since Kinesis Video Streams can't take RTMP as an input, I need an RTMP streaming server to provide me an URL to which I can push using RTMP. Exactly the same than when creating a MediaLive channel with an RTMP PUSH input. But trying to go through the GStreamer documentation this doesn't seem to be possible as the rtmpsink is also a plugin to push media stream using RTMP to an RTMP server... Is the above correct?

Snapcash ended up as a way to pay adult performers for private content over Snapchat, not just a way to split bills with friends. But Snapchat will abandon the peer-to-peer payment space on August 30th. Code buried in Snapchat’s Android app includes a “Snapcash deprecation message” that displays “Snapcash will no longer be available after %s [date]”. Shutting down the feature will bring an end to Snapchat’s four-year partnership with Square to power the feature for sending people money.
Snapcash may have become more of a liability than a utility. With apps like Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, and Square Cash itself, there were plenty of other ways to pay back friends for drinks or Ubers, so Snapcash may have seen low legitimate usage. Meanwhile, a quick Twitter search for “Snapcash” surfaced plenty of offers of erotic content in exchange for payments through the feature. It may have been safer for Snapchat to ditch Snapcash than risk PR problems over its misuse.
TechCrunch tipster Ishan Agarwal provided the below screenshot of Snapchat’s code to TechCrunch. When presented with the code and asked if Snapcash would shut down, a Snapchat spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that it would, explaining: “Yes, we’re discontinuing the Snapcash feature as of August 30, 2018. Snapcash was our first product created in partnership with another company – Square. We’re thankful for all the Snapchatters who used Snapcash for the last four years and for Square’s partnership!” The spokesperson noted that users would be notified in-app and through the support site soon.
Snapcash gave Snapchat a way to get users to connect payment methods to the app. That’s increasingly important as the company aims to become a commerce platforms where you can shop without leaving the app. Having payment info on file is what makes buying things through Snapchat easier than the web and draws brands to use Snapchat storefronts.
We’ll see how Snapchat plans evolve its commerce strategy without this driver. Earlier this month, TechCrunch revealed that Snapchat’s code contained mentions of a project codenamed “eagle” that’s a camera search feature. It was designed to allow users to scan an object or barcode with their Snapchat camera and see product results in Amazon. But since our report, mentions of Amazon have disappeared from the code. It’s unclear what will happen in the future, but camera search could give Snapchat new utility and monetization options.
Snapcash won’t be a part of that future, though. Given Snapchat’s cost-cutting efforts including layoffs , its desperate need to attract and retain advertisers to hit revenue estimates its missed, and its persistent bad rap as a sexting app, it couldn’t afford to support unnecessary features or another scandal. social experiment by Livio Acerbo #greengroundit #techcrunch http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/7ASNM6LvCh8/ Share this:"

I thought I'd try a printable gift voucher but after reading some of the reviews on this site about problems with printing I decided to start with a £10 voucher as a test purchase. It was lucky that I didn't spend the full £150 because it didn't print. Next option was to order gift cards for next day delivery. Amazon don't have an option for £150 so I had to order 2 cards, £50 and £100. Now it turns out that only the £50 card can be delivered on time. All in all a complete waste of time.

EDIT: Due to severe weather issues in his area, dRahme was limited on making audio clips from Sunday Moneytalk. dRahme's Audio Clip : Brinker's comments on Fed, Economy and Debt
CURRENT STOCK MARKET NUMBERS: July 20th, the Dow closed at 25,058 ; the S&P 500 Index at 2802; and the Nasdaq at 7820. BRINKER'S STOCK MARKET COMMENTS ""S&P 500 sitting in about the 2800 level, and since reaching its all-time-historic-peak close in January this year which was at 2872, it's basically been bouncing around. We had a 10.1% pullback over a period of only nine days when there was an inflation scare back in the first quarter. And since that time, its just bounced back and forth a number of times - and basically been in a trading range since January. And that trading range has been - there was a short time in the 2500 - but mainly, it's been in the 2600s, the 2700s, even a little bit around that 2800 level. It's bounced around a lot if you go back to January of 2018. Honey's EC: Brinker has always defined a bear market as a decline of 20% or more, a major correction between 10% and 20%, and a ""noisy"" correction as 10% or less.
Based on Brinker's ""Special Bulletin"" in February 2018, he considered 10.1% a correction and was waiting for retest to issue a new buy-signal. Here are some excerpts: In the February edition of Marketimer we continued to recommend a dollar-cost-average approach for investing new stock market money, especially during periods of market weakness. We also observed that we expected increased volatility this year, and noted that in every mid-term election year since 1962 the market has experienced a decline of at least 7.4%. We also noted that in seven of the last eight mid-term election years dating back to 1986, the decline has been within the category of a correction of less than 20%. The initial stage of the current correction carried the S&P 500 Index into the mid-2500s range during the February 9th trading session as the index searches for the area of an initial bottom. Following the completion of the initial correction phase, we expect the S&P 500 Index to stage a short-term rally which is likely to run out of steam and roll over into a retest of the developing initial bottom area. For subscribers looking to add to stock market positions, our view is that the potential for a Marketimer buy signal would be highest in the event we see a successful test of an initial bottom area. (SNIP) Going forward, if all goes well, we hope to reach a point at which we can upgrade the market to ""attractive for purchase"" at a level close to the eventual closing correction low. However, this can only occur on a successful test of the initial bottom area, accompanied by confirmation based on our analysis of the technical market internals at that time. (SNIP) There are no changes to our model portfolios at this time and we continue to recommend a dollar-cost-average approach for investing new money, especially during periods of market weakness. BOND FUND PERFORMANCE ACCORDING TO BRINKER Caller Jim asked about continuing to hold his Vanguard intermediate and long bond funds: Brinker replied ""We certainly have seen lousy performance from the intermediate and long term bond market since this whole thing (rate increases) has gotten under way in the summer of 2016 Since then, the Federal Funds rate has gone from 3/8% average to 1 7/8%. So that's 150 basis points. And during that time, the ten-year has also gone up 150 basis points...…
Honey EC: The funds that Brinker sold beginning in 2013 with Vanguard Ginnie Mae Fund have done very well.
Jim sums it up well with these comments today: Since Bob Brinker enjoys explaining to people how duration works with bonds maybe he could be so kind to explain to us how the Vanguard Long-Term Treasury Index (VLGSX) which has a duration of 17.2 years is only (-0.36%) over the past 12 months, after all the Fed rate hikes and after the yield on the 10 year Treasury has risen 150 basis points. I guess Vanguard must be lying about performance since Bob has said recently that long term bond funds are ""getting taken to the woodshed"".
July 22, 2018 at 5:52 PM FEDERAL RESERVE. ...Brinker comments: The Federal reserve has a tremendous challenge ahead of it and we don't know yet how it's going to turn out The most difficult task that the Fed has had to deal with is how to move from accommodative policy to a normalized equilibrium policy One of the terms used in the Canyons of Wall Street to describe this is Managing a Soft Landing. …..
ECONOMY EXPANDING. ... BB continued: Because we have an economy that has been expanding for many years...… (Honey Editorial Comment: Mostly the economy was clinging to about 2% for ""many years."" Now some are expecting Q2 to be up to 4%.)
INFLATION.. ... BB continued: ""One of the triggers for raising rates is inflation. We already see inflation figures higher than we'd like to see them. Year-over-year headline Consumer Price Index number 2.9 - that's higher than we'd like to see.
EFFECTS OF TARIFFS SO FAR .... At least twice today, Brinker pointed out that so far, the effects of ""tariffs have been very small - and no big deal.""
SILVER COINS FOR INVESTMENTS .... Brinker strongly advised a caller against buying numismatic coins because of the exorbitant mark ups on them.
HOW MANY RATE HIKES ALREADY ....BB continued: ""They are watching all of this at the Federal Reserve, and at the same time, they are in this rate raising posture which started in December 2015. We've already seen seven rate hikes - with more to come They are also doing Quantitative Tightening. They are taking money off the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve - the money they piled up when they bought all those Quantitative Easing securities. On a maturity basis for now, they are taking these things and putting them back into the open market - where they to be absorbed...."" There is no history for a combined program of raising rates and Quantitative Tightening - never happened. We are very early in QT - have to do $trillions.
UNEMPLOYMENT BELOW 4%. ...BB continued....""We've gone three years now with basically record low. It's been amazing....""
Honey EC: Brinker ignores his prior reports about the very high under-employment rate, and the huge numbers of workers that were cut to part time because of the ACA and gave up looking altogether, which increase welfare, food stamps and SSI (disability) claims. And he never mentions the racial demographics that have drastically changed this past year. Black and Hispanic unemployment are at HISTORIC LOWS.
ESCAPE VELOCITY. ....BB continued: ""Economic policy reaches a point that his described in the Canyons of Wall Street by the economic mucky-mucks as Escape Velocity They are talking about the economy being able to grow on its own in a granular fashion without having the Federal Reserve driving it with low interest rates and highly accommodative monetary policy and financial liquidity....The prevailing wisdom is that we have already reached Escape Velocity. (Honey EC: So it looks like the current President is not going to have the Fed's help maintaining ""Escape Velocity."")
WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAM ....Brinker continued: ""Right now, we have more job listings than qualified applicants Now you know that the government has a dreadful historical record of training citizens to take jobs - training citizens to get them to the level that they can qualify to take jobs. The government is pretty dismal. So there's not a whole lot of hope that is suddenly going to be solved overnight....""
Honey EC: Who's talking about Government doing it, Mr. Brinker?! You must not have heard about President Trump's plan that gets corporations to commit to training STUDENTS AND WORKERS for the jobs that need to be filled. The White House said the ""Pledge to America's Workers"" would provide at least 3.8 million new career opportunities for students and workers over the next five years, including apprenticeships, work-based learning and continuing education. Some of the companies signing the pledge include Apple, Boeing, General Motors, FedEx, The Home Depot, IBM, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Northrop Grumman and Walmart. Several trade associations also committed to the job training initiative, and Trump welcomed several members of Congress and state and local officials, including Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker.
FRANKJ'S MONEYTALK-GUEST SUMMARY:
On Sunday July 22, 2018, Bob piloted the MoneyTalk Starship back in time to September 2008 (once again) to discuss the economic meltdown with Lawrence Ball, a prof at Johns Hopkins University and author of “The Fed and Lehman Brothers: Setting the Record Straight on a Financial Disaster.” The guest thus joins a long conga line of authors who have made a cottage industry out of writing books on this general subject. The book was issued in June 2018 and checking on Amazon (which is where I usually go for the subtitle) I see it has one review. Someone gave it 5 stars. Bob pointed out that Moneytalk was on the air the weekend it became clear that Lehman would be allowed to go under. The Fed did not toss a life ring to Lehman Brothers like they did with Bear Stearns and AIG. (With Bear Stearns they helped broker a buyout). The powers-that-be claimed they did not have legal clearance to help Lehman. The guest said this “reasoning” came about after the fact; Lehman did in fact have collateral of sufficient quality to pledge against a loan from the Fed. We know what happened next. Credit markets froze. Did it have to happen? No, was the guest’s answer. Lehman could have been saved by a loan from the Fed. The guest decried widespread use of the term, “bailout.” It implies free money. In fact, firms who received help from the Fed paid the loans back with interest. Bernanke, Paulson and others realized their mistake in not helping Lehman after they failed. The Fed help to major banks followed shortly thereafter in the interest of avoiding one bank failure after another which is what the guest speculated would have happened. (Some banks took Fed money because to not do so it would appear to Wall Street that they were beyond help – the source on this is a banker I know). Bob brought up the Dodd-Frank act. The guest said some parts of it are in need of revision but they probably won’t be, while parts that will be revised don’t need to be revised. The guest did not completely agree with Bob on the risk of inflation. He does not see the labor market as being as tight as reported by Bob. Therefore he said it would be premature for the Fed to take actions that would slow the economy. He said the Fed should do less and/or do it more slowly. Callers: Martin from Fairbanks asked the guest if he saw the movie, Too Big To Fail? The guest didn’t see it. Martin also asked what the guest thought of Larry Kudlow’s appointment as an economic advisor. Bob cut in after the guest answered the first question so we didn’t hear his opinion of Mr. Kudlow. Bob segued into tariffs. Nathan from San Jose country seemed more interested in making a short speech about bailouts and telling us that he once wrote a paper on the Chrysler bailout. Did the guest think that this started a trend? Paul in Louisiana asked if the reason Lehman didn’t get help was because Henry Paulson did not like Dick Fuld, head of Lehman. The guest said there have been a lot of stories to that effect but they’re somewhat exaggerated. Bob interjected that Paulson, etc. made the wrong call which was to let the firm go vs. making an emergency loan. Bob wrapped up at 3:51. Listen Talk Radio:

Open-box, plus reward certificates and the current sale landed me at about $800. Had to jump.
I'm waiting for the full sized S Pen to arrive via mail, but here are some quick impressions:
This is absolutely the best pen experience at this price this side of the Apple Pencil. Even with the included ""toothpick"" stylus, it's a league above the HP's, Dell's, Lenovo's, etc.
With that said, it took some tinkering to get it working smoothly. This is mostly due, from what I can tell, to Photoshop not being optomized to work with laptops with dGPU's. I had the same issue with my older laptop, and I remember seeing people complain about it with the Surface Book. The solution to this is to go into the Radeon settings and switch the application to ""power saver"" mode. This will force Photoshop to use the intergrated graphics, which is plenty adaquate for raster graphics.
The other thing is it reminded me how much setting up there is with a new Windows machine. Hours. Not to mention bloatware and annoyances like the camera options opening evertime I log into Windows. With an iPad Pro, you're up and running in under 10 minutes. Still, it's worth the trade-off for me to a great pen experience with Photoshop.
When it comes to the S Pen vs the Apple Pencil, I might prefer the S pen. There's a side button, it's lighter, the tip allows for more precision, it provides resistance, and it doesn't require charging. I will say, however, that the 2017 iPad Pro's have an anti-glare coating which reduces the slipperiness.
Overall, my optimizism is high. Only thing is I might try to do an exchange because my unit has some backlight bleed. Just enough to annoy me. Click to expand... In case you're interested.., I've been totally digging this pen on the N9P:

Amazon’s Part Finder can help 2018-07-22T13:56:28Z By Lulu Chang

Your days of going to Lowe’s or Home Depot with a random screw in your hand and a look of quiet desperation on your face will soon be behind you, and it’s all thanks to Amazon. The online retail giant’s greatest gift to us this year may not have anything at all to do with Prime Day , but rather with a new mobile app feature that lets you simply point your smartphone camera at the spare part in question so that Amazon can scan it, match it with the correct item, and then send you to buy said item online.
The app is appropriately named “Part Finder,” and could be a real game changer for home improvement projects everywhere.
Developed by leveraging the technology originally created by Partpic, a company Amazon bought back in 2016, Part Finder is able to identify and match around 100 types of fasteners — screws, nuts, bolts, and the like — which ultimately comprise thousands or even millions of small parts needed for your Ikea furniture, your new deck, and everything in between.
Amazon actually didn’t raise a lot of hoopla around the launch of Part Finder, but it has confirmed that the app’s rollout was completed a couple weeks ago. That means that you could now be using the app to figure out what kind of screw you need to complete the dresser that’s been half-done since 2017.
Using Part Finder is pretty straightforward. It’s not a stand-alone app, but rather a feature that you can access once you’ve opened the Amazon app on your iPhone. Then, you can select the camera icon located in the top right-hand corner, and then tap the bottom of the screen and select “Part Finder.”
You’ll need to place the part next to a penny atop a white sheet of paper — this is to help Amazon figure out how big of a part you’re trying to find. Amazon will then scan the part and let you know what you’re looking for.
To be fair, if you really want to be certain that Amazon’s found parts are in fact correct, you’ll likely still want to pay a visit to the local hardware store (or national chain). But if you have a sense of what you’re looking for, this tool could be an excellent way to save time and some money, and quickly get you whatever you need.
For the time being, it would appear that Part Finder is available only on iOS. We’ll update you when the Android version becomes available."

Just got a GB12 (mostly for art) and could use some help with a few things...
1. The keyboard cover is a bit flimsy and I've already dropped the tablet once. The tablet seems fine, but the USB-C cable connector got slightly bent. I carefully bent it back but now the tablet charges very slowly. I hope it's just the cable and not an internal problem from the drop. I've searched Google and Amazon for a replacement cable but can't find an official Samsung one. Will any USB-C 3.0 cable work? Might pick one up at a local store if so.
2. I've noticed that I can't set my pen button to right click through the GB settings, so I'm using Windows Ink for the first time to long press right click (always had Ink disabled on my desktop PC). It works fine in Windows and Photoshop, but I can't right click layers or the canvas in Clip Studio via long press. Not being able to right click at all in Clip Studio is a pain. Anyone else have this problem with Clip Studio? Anyone know a fix? At this point really missing the two button functionality of my Intuos 4 pen I use on the desktop. Could right click and change brush size on the fly with that setup. Any way to get better pen button functionality on the GB?"

All is forgiven and soon Sunset Beach winks from the distance, until Mina’s stuck with dog sitting duties for Jim, her buddy Bauser’s three-legged dog. Complicating the canine conundrum is Bauser’s last minute plea to deliver Jim to a client location, in Bumville, New Jersey. No biggie, except that Bumville lies in the polar opposite direction from Cape May. And Vito and Miriam also happen to be visiting the client–who is none other than Vito’s niece, Helena Pryzchntchynzski. Oy.
Further jeopardizing their journey through Jersey is Jim’s discovery of Babette Bernstein. Her murder launches a connect-the-dots of corpses that ripples dangerously around Mina and Jack. Oh–and the kidnappings, plural–are a little scary, too.
Will Mina and Jack escape the bad guys? Will they survive their first vacation together? More importantly, will they finally have one?
If you’re in the mood for funny fiction, a cast of chatty pets, and unsolved murders–read on. Juicy Jersey packs a roller coaster ride of murders, mayhem and mojitos. Come root for Mina, boo the bad guys and nibble a nosh, courtesy of the author’s recipes in the back of the book, vetted by Lund’s real-life favorite chef, her husband, Chef Andrew. ??? READERS’ FAVORITE 5-STARS for PERFECTLY PICKLED: If You Love Stephanie Plum, Wait Until You Meet Mina Kitchen!!!
“This is my first book by Lizz Lund and let me tell you, it won’t be my last! Filled with quirky characters, hysterical dialogue and a main character who always seems to be surrounded by hijinks, Perfectly Pickled is one of the best cozy mysteries I have read since Janet Evonovich’s Stephanie Plum series.” ??? READERS’ FAVORITE 5-STARS for CONFECTION CONNECTION: More LOLs to Chase the Winter Blues!
“I have fallen in love with this series! Just can’t get enough of Mina and friends, especially Vinnie. I want a Vinnie of my very own! I’ll be recommending this author to all of my friends and family to brighten their days and pee their pants, in that order…” ??? READERS’ FAVORITE 5-STARS for CHRISTMAS BIZARRE: I Loved the Characters
“I’ve been a fan of Janet Evanovich for years, and found Lizz Lund right up there with Janet. They have similar styles, and a comic flair. I loved the characters…I love a good mystery, and at the same time a good laugh (often laughing out loud while I’m reading) from the story, and this book definitely filled the bill.” ??? AMAZON “VINE VOICE” 5-STAR REVIEW for KITCHEN ADDICTION: OMG! Can you say LOL too much?! Loved it!
“OMG! Couldn’t stop laughing! Of course, having been to Lancaster frequently and having friends there, I felt right at home, but this was a much more eclectic collection of characters! Made me want to be in their circle, a part of their lives for some time to come. Will be checking immediately for more from this author.” Scroll up NOW and click the “buy now with 1 click” button!

SOLID RED. The light is NOT flashing. Does a steady red light similarly
indicate that location verification has failed. If that is the problem, do
you have a suggested action or number of actions to rectify? For instance,
do you suggest starting from scratch and reinstall the Microcell? Or, am I,
like you say so o.l.?
"" Who is your ISP or what kind of internet service do you have"" Please
advise why you think this may make a difference to a steady red light and
an inoperative Microcell. BTW I have Comcast, Xfinity HD. That is NOT the
problem. If it were it would have shown itself sometime in the last three
years.
PS - you didn't answer my question. Would you recommend trying a different
adapter, from another device I have, that has a 12v output. My ATT adapter
is 12V and 4.16 Amp Max
PPS - I am NOT going to order a volt meter from Amazon to get here in two
days, Mostly because I doubt the problem is the adaptor, since it makes
little sense that turning it off and then back on would have caused it to
stop sending enough current suddenly, after three years of running perfectly
and giving me 5 bars. Oh how I miss the five bars. In the meanwhile I have
gone to wi-fi calling, but that is going to eat a lot of minutes. I'm
beginning to consider switching to Verizon after 8 years of paying ATT
$200+ a month. ATT has lousy coverage almost anyplace I go"

If you’re a photographer, then you’ve purchased equipment and more likely than not, it was from an online vendor. Today, we see something we want, perhaps read some customer reviews, and then purchase that shiny piece of photography equipment. But have you ever thought about those reviews? Who wrote them and why?
This video from Beme looks at the world of product reviews that are posted online for almost everything we consume. Reviews are everywhere from Amazon, to Yelp, to Fred’s Hotdog Stand. But where do these reviews come from and how honest are they? I know when I’m shopping for anything online, I always look at the reviews. Of course, I start with the star rating and then read at least some of the reviews, but am I wasting my time? I don’t think so. I try to filter out the simple one-sentence reviews that say things like “this is junk” or “the greatest ever.” However, review scammers are more sophisticated than that and will develop reviews that highlight just what the seller wants them to focus on. National Public Radio’s (NPR) podcast Planet Money recently did an episode (episode #850) called “The Fake Reviewer Hunter” on this very topic and talked to a professional reviewer. Between the Beme and the Planet Money episodes, it makes one think about how much weight they should put into reviews for products they plan to buy. The best bet may be to forgo customer reviews and stick with dedicated industry sites .
So, tell us if you use customer reviews when making a purchase. If you do, tell us how you use them to make your decision. Posted In:"

Roland Quandt Samsung is reportedly planning to release a two-in-one charger for its smartphones and the upcoming Galaxy Watch. Packaging for the Wireless Charger Duo has leaked ahead of Samsungâ€™s Unpacked press conference, which will be held at Barclays Center on August 9th.
The Wireless Charger Duo box reveals that itâ€™s capable of charging either two Qi-compatible phones simultaneously or one phone and the Galaxy Watch. Both placement areas support fast wireless charging. The upcoming Note 9 is rumored to feature a 4,000mAh battery, and Samsung has registered a new wireless charge r that could improve upon the already-fast wireless recharge capabilities of recent Galaxy smartphones. Itâ€™s not yet clear whether the Wireless Charger Duo will be capable of that higher output.
After early rumors hinted at Samsung making a return to Googleâ€™s Wear OS with its next smartwatch, thatâ€™s looking less and less likely. The Galaxy Watch is believed to again run the companyâ€™s own Tizen software.
The Wireless Charger Duo comes as Apple continues working away on its AirPower mat, which was first announced at last Septemberâ€™s iPhone event. While two-way chargers are relatively common, Apple has said that AirPower will simultaneously charge three devices â€"" such as an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. In June, Bloomberg reported that Apple has faced â€œa series of technical hurdlesâ€ during the course of AirPowerâ€™s development, such as making sure the charging mat doesnâ€™t overheat and working with its â€œcomplexâ€ circuitry.
Aga in, Samsungâ€™s Wireless Charger Duo just covers two devices at once. The companyâ€™s Icon X earbuds donâ€™t support wireless charging as of yet. But if youâ€™re planning to pick up both the Note 9 and Galaxy Watch, it might prove a convenient (albeit probably very pricey) accessory.

Two years ago Professor Yair Auron and attorney Eitay Mack submitted a Freedom of Information request to the Israel’s defence ministry to discover the nature of any arms exports made to Rwanda between 1990 and 1995, the Times of Israel reports. Between 800,000 and 1 million people were killed over the course of 100 days in Rwanda in 1994 during the civil war, kick started by the death of the Hutu President Juvenal Habyrimana whose plane was shot down over Kigali airport. Weapons used in the genocide allegedly included Israeli-made 5.56mm bullets, rifles and grenades, the newspaper reports, but information apparently detailing this is sealed in the contested documentation. Mr Auron and Mr Mack’s request reportedly stated: “According to various reports in Israel and abroad, the defence exports to Rwanda ostensibly violated international law, at least during the period of the weapons embargo imposed by the UN Security Council.” The request was denied by the Ministry of Defence and later by the Tel Aviv District Court, upholding the argument that the release of information would undermine state security and international relations. The Supreme Court has also rejected the appeal for the documents to be released, stating: “We found that under the circumstances the disclosure of the information sought does not advance the public interest claimed by the appellants to the extent that it takes preference and precedence over the claims of harm to state security and international relations,” Haaretz reports. Mr Mack responded to the decision by calling it “mistaken and immoral,” but said that “at no point during the proceedings was there a denial that there were defence exports during the genocide,” and vowed to “continue to fight to expose the truth”.[/sign] Disclosure: Lunaticoutpost.com is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program , an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.

These Foods Linked to Ongoing Outbreaks in Some States Might Make You Sick
US health officials are warning people to avoid certain foods due to ongoing unrelated outbreaks of intestinal infections caused by bacteria, viruses and even parasites lurking in some of our food.
Hereâs what to stay away from: Pasta salad
Hy-Vee, a Midwestern grocery store chain, has recalled a pasta salad that might be linked to at least 20 people getting sick from salmonella. Hy-Vee, based in Iowa, sold the 1-pound and 3-pound plastic containers of Spring Pasta Salad in eight states.
The states are Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota â"" where the salmonella illnesses were reported â"" and Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Wisconsin.
The product was produced between June 1 and July 13. The packages have expiration dates between June 22 and August 3.
Symptoms of salmonella begin 12 to 72 hours after a person is infected and inclu de diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramping. This can last about four to seven days, and most individuals recover without treatment. However, those who develop severe diarrhea may need to be hospitalized. Those who are very young, who are very old or who have compromised immune systems are most at risk for complications and severe cases of illness. Raw turkey
Salmonella is the culprit in 90 illnesses linked to raw turkey products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Agriculture.
The illnesses have been reported in 26 states since November. But health officials have not identified a brand, product or supplier as the source of the outbreak.
Patients who have been interviewed reported eating âdifferent types and brands of turkey products purchased from many different locations. Two ill people lived in a household where raw turkey pet food was fed to pets,â the CDC said.
In addition, samples of raw t urkey pet food, raw turkey products and live turkeys have tested positive for the outbreak strain of salmonella, which could mean the outbreak is âwidespread in the turkey industry,â the CDC said. Cut melon
Put down the fork and step away from cut melon or fruit salad mixes that contain it.
The US Food and Drug Administration is warning people in 23 states that the fruit may be contaminated with salmonella.
The outbreak has affected 60 people mostly in five Midwestern states, with about half of them hospitalized.
Cut watermelon, honeydew and cantaloupe as well as fruit salads containing these melons have been recalled in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
The fruits were sold in stores such as Walmart, Kroger, Walgreens, Sprout s Farmers Market, Costco and Whole Foods/Amazon. Kelloggâs Honey Smacks cereal
Federal health officials want you to toss out all boxes of Kelloggâs Honey Smacks. The warning is due to an outbreak of salmonella that has left 100 people sick in 33 states.
The cereal was recalled June 14, but one month later, another warning not to eat the cereal was issued after the FDA said it was aware that it was still available.
âRetailers cannot legally offer the cereal for sale and consumers should not purchase Kelloggâs Honey Smacks cereal,â the agency said. Swiss rolls
Flowers Foods announced a recall of Swiss rolls because they may be contaminated with salmonella. The ingredient whey powder was recalled for possible contamination. There have been no reports of illness from Swiss rolls, according to the company.
Swiss rolls sold nationwide under the brand names Mrs. Freshleyâs, Food Lion, H-E-B, Bakerâs Treat, Market Square, an d Great Value have been recalled. Captain John Derstâs Old Fashioned Bread distributed in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina have also been recalled, the company said. Ritz Cracker Sandwiches
MondelÄ""z Global LLC announced a voluntary recall of certain Ritz Cracker Sandwiches and other Ritz Bits products because they contain whey powder that has been recalled for possible salmonella contamination. The products are available nationwide.
The voluntary recall is a precaution, as no complaints of illness have been reported, the company said.
The recalled product list includes Ritz Bits cheese cracker sandwiches and mixed cookie and cracker variety packs. McDonaldâs salads
As a precaution, McDonaldâs has stopped selling salads in 3,000 locations in 14 states to try to contain an outbreak of cyclospora illness.
The states no longer selling these salads are Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Oh io, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Kentucky, West Virginia and Missouri.
To date, 163 cases have been confirmed in 10 states since May 1, according to the CDC.
The cyclospora parasite causes intestinal illness as a result of consuming contaminated food or water. Symptoms can begin a week or more after consuming the parasite. They include diarrhea and frequent, sometimes explosive bowel movements, according to the CDC. Those who are infected might also experience loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps or pain, nausea, gas and fatigue. Vomiting, headache, fever, body aches and flu-like symptoms can also occur.
The illness can last from a few days to a few months, and patients might feel better but then get worse again. Patients can be treated with antibiotics. Vegetable trays
Before you grab something off that vegetable tray, make sure it hasnât been recalled.
The FDA is investigating at least 237 cases of cyclospora illnesses linked to recalled Del Monte Fresh vegetable trays. The trays contained broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and dill dip, and they were sold in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana.
âFDA has not identified which of the ingredients is the vehicle for this outbreak; each component of these vegetable trays is under consideration,â the agency said.
Cyclospora cayetanensis is a microscopic parasite that contaminates food or water and, when ingested, causes an intestinal illness. Symptoms include diarrhea, with sometimes explosive bowel movements, loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps, bloating, nausea and fatigue. Imported crab meat
Avoid eating fresh crab meat from Venezuela. Thatâs the advice from the FDA due to an outbreak of Vibrio parahaemolyticus that started in April. In all, 12 illnesses have been reported in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Louisiana and the District of Columbia.
âThis product is commonly f ound in plastic tubs and may be labeled as âpre-cooked,â â the FDA said in its outbreak announcement.
Symptoms usually begin 24 hours after consuming the bacteria. They include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, fever and abdominal pain. Twelve people have become sick."

They’re pressboard but actual wood chips, not that cardboard blend shit IKEA usually uses. It’s definitely sturdier than IKEA, but not quite as sturdy as actual wood, obviously.
Our Sauder bookcase has held up far better than the Billy or the replacement Hemnes one we purchased in the past. Currently have about 100-150 books on our Sauder with no signs of bowing after 2 years.
The only issue is you have to order them from online for most stores."

Samsung is reportedly planning to release a two-in-one charger for its smartphones and the upcoming Galaxy Watch. Packaging for the Wireless Charger Duo has leaked ahead of Samsungâs Unpacked press conference, which will be held at Barclays Center on August 9th.
The Wireless Charger Duo box reveals that itâs capable of charging either two Qi-compatible phones simultaneously or one phone and the Galaxy Watch. Both placement areas support fast wireless charging. The upcoming Note 9 is rumored to feature a 4,000mAh battery, and Samsung has registered a new wireless charge r that could improve upon the already-fast wireless recharge capabilities of recent Galaxy smartphones. Itâs not yet clear whether the Wireless Charger Duo will be capable of that higher output.
After early rumors hinted at Samsung making a return to Googleâs Wear OS with its next smartwatch, thatâs looking less and less likely. The Galaxy Watch is believed to again run the companyâs own Tizen software.
The Wireless Charger Duo comes as Apple continues working away on its AirPower mat, which was first announced at last Septemberâs iPhone event. While two-way chargers are relatively common, Apple has said that AirPower will simultaneously charge three devices â"" such as an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. In June, Bloomberg reported that Apple has faced âa series of technical hurdlesâ during the course of AirPowerâs development, such as making sure the charging mat doesnât overheat and working with its âcomplexâ circuitry.
Aga in, Samsungâs Wireless Charger Duo just covers two devices at once. The companyâs Icon X earbuds donât support wireless charging as of yet. But if youâre planning to pick up both the Note 9 and Galaxy Watch, it might prove a convenient (albeit probably very pricey) accessory.

Superhero High T.H. Hernandez Published by: Soul Mate Publishing Publication date: July 5th 2018 Genres: Adventure, Science Fiction, Young Adult
Sixteen-year-old Annarenee Stevens is the sole member of her family without a super power. The only time she feels powerful is in the pool. With her sights set on swimming for U.C. Berkeley, she’s ready to win it all at the State championship and secure her future.
When the government unexpectedly ends the secret Genetically Enhanced Asset (GEA) program, Annarenee is uprooted from Dayton, the only home she’s ever known, and relocated to San Diego with all of the other GEA families. Queen of her public school, Annarenee is just another zero at Superhero High, a school without any sports teams.
With the end of the program, her hero older brother now needs a college education, too, meaning the only way Annarenee is getting into Berkeley is on a scholarship. Her dream is slipping through her fingers, no matter how tightly she clings to it. To make matters worse, super hot superhero, Ren Gonzalez, is paying too much attention to her. The kind of attention that has Ren’s ex-girlfriend intent on making Annarenee’s life even more miserable.
But when heroes begin disappearing, zeros and heroes will be forced to team up in order to solve the mystery. If they don’t kill each other first.

EXCERPT:
Smith slides in beside me and drapes his arm around me, kissing the side of my head. Ryan glances over his shoulder before backing up. “You guys are coming tonight, right?” “Wouldn’t miss it,” Smith answers for both of us. The drive to my house is less than five minutes. On the way Smith leans in and whispers in my ear, “Anyone going to be home?” I shake my head then wonder if I should have lied. Smith’s been hinting more frequently that he wants to have sex. We’ve been dating for three months, but unlike Smith, I’m not ready. Call me old-fashioned, but I want my first time to be special. I like Smith, he’s cute, popular, and funny, but I’m not in love with him. Plus, I’m pretty sure you shouldn’t keep secrets from the person you share the most intimate part of yourself with, and I’m keeping a huge secret from Smith. We pull up in front of my house, and Smith and I hop out, grabbing our stuff from the back. “I’ll call you later,” Ronny yells as Ryan roars off. I wave as they turn the corner and disappear, nerves twisting in my belly as Smith takes my hand. I glance at him, my gaze drawn to his crystal blue eyes beneath messy-wild blond hair. Smith moved here last summer and rapidly became one of the most popular guys in our class. He’s always tan and his body is cut, a result of time spent in the pool or surfing in his native Florida. Every single girl in our school, and possibly even a few with boyfriends, would be thrilled to have my problem. I need to figure this out soon before he decides he’s tired of waiting. Smith guides me up the walkway toward the porch, and I wonder how far I can let him go this time before I put on the brakes. Our front door opens and two men dressed in black suits, white button-ups, black ties, and sunglasses exit our house. The taller of the two seems to size me up behind his dark lenses before he nods and passes. I turn and watch them get into a black Escalade parked across the street. My brother, Noah, cruises up and parks his vintage blue Mustang convertible in the driveway. He climbs out, his eyes glued to the SUV as it pulls away from the curb. Smith snorts. “What are the Blues Brothers doing here?” I don’t share his humor and instead turn toward my brother, eyebrows raised in silent question. Noah shakes his head, and inside my own head, I hear, “I don’t know, they were blocking me.” A chill runs through me starting in the pit of my stomach. It’s not unusual to get a visit from the Men in Black, but my parents should be at work, and Noah should still be at his school for another couple of hours. Something is wrong. “ Don’t panic, AR, ” Noah says in my head. I turn to Smith, “Um, I’ll call you later, okay? Pick me up at eight?” He leans in and kisses my cheek. “Sure. Wear something sexy.” He smiles and waggles his eyebrows. “ Douchebag ,” Noah says only to me before heading inside.

Click here to find out how. Through tonight: Showers and embedded thunderstorms will continue to rotate through the region in batches for the rest of the evening and into the part of the overnight period. Guidance suggests areas along and east of Interstate 95 stand the greatest chance at seeing additional heavy rainfall. Some of the storm cells that do develop will contain gusty winds and lightning, but the biggest hazard by far will be the threat of flash floods, especially east of the District, where sopping-wet soil can’t hold any more water. (Some spots there received upward of 7 inches of rain Saturday.) Elevated chances (60 percent) of scattered showers and thunderstorms exist through midnight, before storm coverage should begin to wane. It will be warm and quite muggy overnight, with a 50-percent chance of scattered showers or even an isolated thunderstorm. Low temperatures will range from 68 to 73 degrees, with a southeast wind at 10 mph. Rainy day in D.C. Shamila Chaudhary via Flickr . View the current weather at The Washington Post. Tomorrow (Monday): Scattered showers are likely to form early in the morning, with an outside chance at a pre-dawn rumble of thunder or two. Our shower and thunderstorm chances will only increase as the day progresses. Patches of heavy rain and thunderstorms will continuously rotate in from the south, possibly becoming “ trained ” over the same locations, increasing the probabilities of flash floods. Don’t expect much if any sunshine Monday, with high temperatures only reaching the low 80s. Humidity values will be oppressive: Dew points will rise into the low 70s, with only some aid from a moderate (10 to 15 mph) southeast wind. Expect more showers and thunderstorms Monday night, as we stay warm and muggy with lows in the low 70s. See Rick Grow’s forecast through next week.

Saturday’s deluge was not the best way to kick of a week’s long stretch where we will probably be under the treat of heavy rain every day. WPC forecast for accumulated precipitation through Friday morning. Much of the east coast could end up an additional 2 to 5-plus inches of rain by the end of the week. Thanks to an unusually strong (for late July) upper-level low and huge blocking high over the North Atlantic, we are stuck in an extremely favorable pattern for heavy rain. And this could go beyond just causing us a nuisance or ruining our summer vacation plans. Last week, we mentioned the historic D.C. rainfall from June 2006 as a potential analogous event to our current wet pattern, and that comparison is looking pretty good at the moment. With such an efficient environmental setup for heavy precipitation, some areas could (including totals from Saturday) end up with close to a foot of rain by the end of the week. With totals like that in the realm of possibilities, flood reports and incidents will easily be on the rise as the week continues. Want our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?

SOLID RED. The light is NOT flashing. Does a steady red light similarly
indicate that location verification has failed. If that is the problem, do
you have a suggested action or number of actions to rectify? For instance,
do you suggest starting from scratch and reinstall the Microcell? Or, am I,
like you say so o.l.?

PPS - I am NOT going to order a volt meter from Amazon to get here in two
days, Mostly because I doubt the problem is the adaptor, since it makes
little sense that turning it off and then back on would have caused it to
stop sending enough current suddenly, after three years of running perfectly
and giving me 5 bars. Oh how I miss the five bars. In the meanwhile I have
gone to wi-fi calling, but that is going to eat a lot of minutes. I'm

Seattle: Amazon Digital Services, [2017] 2018. ISBN 978-1-980820-95-6. Have you sometimes felt, since an early age, that you were an alien, somehow placed on Earth and observing the antics of humans as if they were a different species? Why do they believe such stupid things? Why do they do such dumb things? Any why do they keep doing them over and over again seemingly incapable of learning from the bad outcomes of all the previous attempts?
That is how Cal Adler felt since childhood and, like most people with such feelings, kept them quiet and bottled up while trying to get ahead in a game whose rules often seemed absurd. In his senior year in high school, he encounters a substitute guidance counsellor who tells him, without any preliminary conversation, precisely how he feels. He's assured he is not alone, and that over time he will meet others. He is given an enigmatic contact in case of emergency. He is advised, as any alien in a strange land, to blend in while observing and developing his own talents. And that's the last he sees of the counsellor.
Cal's subsequent life is punctuated by singular events: a terrorist incident in which he spontaneously rises to the occasion, encountering extraordinary people, and being initiated into skills he never imagined he'd possess. He begins to put together a picture of a shadowy… something …of which he may or may not be a part, whose goals are unclear, but whose people are extraordinary.
Meanwhile, a pop religion called ReHumanism, founded by a science fiction writer, is gaining adherents among prominent figures in business, entertainment, and technology. Its “scriptures” advocate escape from the tragic cycle of progress and collapse which has characterised the human experience by turning away from the artificial environment in which we have immersed ourselves and rediscovering our inherent human nature which may, to many in the modern world, seem alien. Is there a connection between ReHumanism (which seems like a flaky scam to Cal) and the mysterious people he is encountering?
All of these threads begin to come together when Cal, working as a private investigator in Reno, Nevada, is retained by the daughter of a recently-deceased billionaire industrialist to find her mother, who has disappeared during a tourist visit to Alaska. The mother is revealed have become a convert to and supporter of ReHumanism. Are they involved? And how did the daughter find Cal, who, after previous events, has achieved a level of low observability stealth aircraft designers can only dream of?
An adventure begins in which nothing is as it seems and all of Cal's formidable talents are tested to their limits.
This is an engaging and provocative mystery/thriller which will resonate with those who identify with the kind of heroic, independent, and inner-directed characters that populate the fiction of Robert A. Heinlein and other writers of the golden age of science fiction. It speaks directly to those sworn to chart their own course through life regardless of what others may think or say. I'm not sure the shadowy organisation we glimpse here actually exists, but I wish it did…and I wish they'd contacted me. There are many tips of the hat here to works and authors of fiction with similar themes, and I'm sure many more I missed.
This is an example of the efflorescence of independent science fiction which the obsolescence of the traditional gatekeeper publishers has engendered. With the advent of low-cost, high-margin self-publishing and customer reviews and ratings to evaluate quality, an entire new cohort of authors whose work would never before have seen the light of day is now enriching the genre and the lives of their enthusiastic readers. The work is not free of typographical and grammatical errors, but I've read books from major science fiction publishers with more. The Kindle edition is free to Kindle Unlimited subscribers.

Local author and historian Sharon Giacomazzi will share some of her discoveries of area tombstones and cemeteries in a free presentation, “Tombstone Tourism,” at 6:30 p.m. Aug. 3 at Fresno Flats Historic Village and Park.
The presentation will include cemeteries and grave sites from Sonora to Yosemite, Bass Lake, Raymond and near McSwain Reservoir. Those attending the presentation will have the opportunity to join Giacomazzi the following day, Aug. 4, on a field trip to visit some of the featured grave sites: Bass Lake where four men who worked on the dam are buried and the Westfall cemetery near Fish Camp. Sharon Giacomazzi, local author, hiker, backpacker and historian, will present “Tombstone Tourism” in a free program at Fresno Flats at 6:30 p.m. on Aug. 3. The following day, she will lead a field trip to two area tombstone/cemetery sites. Debbie Sebastian Special to the Sierra Star
Giacomazzi has hiked and backpacked 13,000 miles of trails in the 35 years she has spent exploring the local mountain area but it has only been in the past year that she has focused her exploration on cemeteries and gravesites.
One of her favorites is the Cassaretto pioneer family gravesite near McSwain Reservoir. “It sits on a knoll overlooking the lake,” she explains. Another favorite, “because of the setting that is oh, so peaceful,” is the Grub Gulch cemetery which sits on private land along Road 600.
The self-described “very senior citizen” explains, “I have an insatiable curiosity and I’m also always jonesing around. I scour maps, I go on outings and I drive around a lot.” Sixty hikes are featured in Sharon Giacomazzi’s “Trails & Tales of Yosemite & the Central Sierra.”
Giacomazzi has published three books and a fourth will be published next year. Her “Trails & Tales of Yosemite & the Central Sierra” is a respected guide to 60 hikes in Yosemite and the surrounding Sierra. In addition to trail maps and photographs, she included introductory sections giving an overview of the history and geography of the hiking areas.
When the summers heat up, the author heads for cooler temperatures along Tioga Road and on the eastern side of the Sierra. These wanderings led to two additional books: “Exploring Eastern Sierra Canyons: Sonora Pass to Pine Creek” and “Exploring the Eastern Sierras: Bishop to Lone Pine.” Both books feature hikes, backpacks, campgrounds, wildflowers and histories of the areas.
Giacomazzi’s curiosity has led to new explorations and discoveries lately as she has been combing the area for unusual outhouses. Her article “Sierra Sitters” was published recently in the California Explorer. She has been a senior staff writer for that magazine for 20 years.
All of the author’s books are available locally at Branches Bookstore in Oakhurst and on Amazon.

I'm sorry about your sis. As much as it may hurt her a bit..I'm positive she'll understand.
I also used wondfo opks from amazon. I felt they were the best. I have heard DS ones are not great for actually showing.g positive.
My cm was also pretty accurate but I'm also a textbook ovulator. My issue was keeping the babes in there.
I'd definitely say if you arent regular you should not go off the app. For sure if you can..have sex every 3 days until you are sure you have ovulated.
Remember ovulation can happen almost 48hrs after getting a positive opk. Keep bding a few days after the pos.
Fx Thanks for your response. I think I'll order those opks from Amazon when AF arrives this month. I started getting sore breasts and mild cramping the last couple days but those symptoms can be related to anything hormonal so I'll wait a while to see how it all goes."

So nice to see all the support in this thread for our September 2016 mamas ❤
Hubby and I are currently TTC our 2nd. I'm finding so many conflicting emotions. I always wanted a bigger family and hubby is agreeable to at least 2. I was blessed to be able to be pregnant with my sister the last time. After our babes turned one, my sister had a devastating health event and is still recovering. We always said we would be pregnant together for our next ones and she will not be able to try for at least a couple years. . So I feel awful going ahead with my life (but understand of course that I have to move ahead with my own goals).
So I started this app to try and track my ovulation. I'm still breastfeeding so I'm not very regular with my cycles, I used to be so regular with 30 day cycles now it ranges between 40 and 60 days, the app rarely predicts my period days accurately so I doubt the ovulation days are accurate. So with all that my predicted ovulation day is July 12th. We BD'd on the 4th, 9th and 15th. If we're as lucky as we were with my first then it should be quick so I'm a little new to the TTC process. I should probably track my ovulation with a kit. I'm thinking dollar store ones are best cost wise? I also find conflicting evidence online to how long sperm can survive inside us. What timelines do you go by for BD'ing around suspected days of ovulation? And do you find tracking your vaginal discharge to be accurate? Looking forward to sharing updates and always grateful for the support!! Hey! I don’t know how I missed this.
First off, welcome!
Im sorry to hear about your sister, I hope she feels better and I’m sure she’ll understand you have to move on and continue growing ur family.
I recommend getting the opks off amazon, so cheap, I think you get 50 opks and 20 pregnancy tests.
I use opks and I can usually tell based off my CM.
Try to bd as much as u can, but I agree with everything Kelsey said. Especially about how long the sperm lives. Every woman is different, and the vagina is so friggen hostile it kills off so much sperm looool.
Good luck!!"

As we enter the final month of the year, things are not looking good for Tesla (TSLA). The Model 3 ramp continues at a sluggish pace, and the latest estimates for November deliveries of current models was a big disappointment. With key borrowing and some material costs also soaring, Tesla is not likely to hold $300 a share if the bad news keeps piling up.
First, we have the InsideEvs estimate for Model 3 deliveries in November. While the chart below might show strong growth, an increase of 200 units to 345 total is not a tremendous reason to celebrate. Through its first five months, the Model 3 is at a total of 712 units, while the Chevy Bolt (GM) saw just under 3,000 units in November alone. As a comparison, in the first five months of Bolt sales, Chevy sold nearly 5,000 units.

But there was more upbeat news elsewhere, with No. 3 airline United Continental(NYSE:UAL) beating on earnings and freight rail titan CSX(NASDAQ:CSX) delivering record first-quarter numbers. Also on the rapid growth train: Intuitive Surgical(NASDAQ:ISRG), whose da Vinci systems are selling at an impressive rate. And speaking of sales of tech products, the guys close out the episode by explaining why it’s a win-win that Amazon.com(NASDAQ:AMZN) and Best Buy(NYSE:BBY) are joining forces to sell smart TVs. [By Motley Fool Staff]
In the healthcare world, one of those has to be the impressive quarterly report from Intuitive Surgical(NASDAQ:ISRG). The company increased its revenue by 25%, and accelerated its sales of the da Vinci robotic surgical systems that made it famous. But it’s not just the expensive hardware that is allowing it to prosper — it’s that every machine needs a steady supply of the disposable instruments and accessories used during its procedures. The Fools consider the recent numbers, the outlook, and the investment thesis for Intuitive Surgical stock. But in the, say, anti-healthcare space, cigarette slingerPhilip Morris International(NYSE:PM) took a big hit as demand slackened in major foreign markets. Sales of its e-cig devices are also not growing the way management had hoped. [By Chris Lange]

Scientists Finally Discovered the Truth About Easter Island published: 29 Oct 2017 views: 10991305
We all know that the easter island heads have bodies – that’s not a mystery at all. But how did the easter island population build hundreds of statues? Scientists have recently solved this mystery and discovered where these people disappeared to and why. For many decades, people\'s minds have been occupied with the mystery of Easter Island. A remote piece of volcanic soil, far away in the Pacific Ocean... But our planet hosts thousands of such lonely islands, what is so particular about this one? The mystery is concealed not in the island itself but giant stone statues covering it. Who created the world-famous huge stone heads? Did they serve any specific purpose? Where did their creators arrive from and where did they disappear? Well, it seems the answer is finally just around the corner!

Sounds like I should accelerate my sales plans. Scratch accelerate. Execute . Execute a sales plan. Now. The time you are spending on this forum is delaying you. You are also going to get nailed by Close Periods. If you are that senior, you are almost certainly privy to material price sensitive information. Your windows for sale are not large-- and make sure you have cleared it with requisite authorities (usually compliance or Chief Legal Officer's office)-- that's probably ""as read"" for you, but just in case a 3rd party is reading this and faces a similar issue. On whether I've already won and don't ""need"" any more: I figured I'd retire early if I hit $20M, as 5% long-term return would yield my current salary. That said, I'm not willing to gamble the whole pot in the hopes of getting to $20M sooner, so I will definitely diversify. Oh so very very dangerous. Many of us are veterans of conversations like that during the dot com era. Some (wisely) cashed out, some did not. Don't think because you can make this money at the top of the cycle, that you can make anything like that at the bottom. BTW it's life changing to hit $1m. It's probably life changing to hit $5m. After that? We have exited the realm of conceivable material need, and entered into the land of ranking ourselves against our peers. Read Andrew Tobias' Getting By on $1m a Year article, and Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities . These were about Wall Street in the 1980s, and you'd have to roughly double the numbers to get to a similar cost of living, now, but they are instructive as to lifestyle inflation. (I recognize in this that a 4 year college education for your kid can cost $200k+, and that a house in Bay Area can be $2-3m). If I sell everything now, I should end up with a total of something like $10M in assets after paying taxes on my options-- which is still great, as I think I could reach $20M around age 50 if my income and savings rate never change. To retire on $10M, I would need to adjust my lifestyle or leave the SF Bay Area, and I'd rather keep working. We have a baby and plan to have another, so I'm not retiring to Thailand any time soon. As above. Shallowpockets wrote: ↑ Sun Jul 22, 2018 3:52 pm This is not an unfamiliar subject on these board. Windfalls of stock, options, etc. Posters never seem to want to name the stock. Why? I am curious, not on the why, on the stock. Would there be some financial or secret reason people will not say? Couple reasons: Small chance I (and my salary and savings) could be identified by a colleague reading the forum Even smaller chance that anything I say about my bullishness for my company could somehow be read as insider information (revenue or industry trends, etc.) Suffice to say, it's an established FAANG company. So while it's not bulletproof (I'm cognizant of Yahoo et al), it's not a flash-in-the-pan IPO, either. [/quote] In the age of the web confidentiality is warranted. That kind of money would make you or your family kidnapping fodder in a lot of places. There's a reason Russians and many Emerging Markets rich send their kids to English boarding schools-- it's an island 700 miles long (Great Britain), and kidnappers probably won't get very far (the Skripal team by contrast appears to have left the country before discovery). Look at the share prices of Amazon, Microsoft during the dot com bust 2000-03 and post. Let alone Yahoo AOL Time Warner, Cisco, Lucent, Intel, IBM, HP etc. i.e. where there are current ""winners"" they still collapsed in price, let alone the losers. Imagine the US government seized assets of Amazon, for example, or indicted Jeff Bezos for some crimes? Stock price of Amazon would be a lot lower? From memory, it's something like 2012 before an investor in Amazon 2000 got their money back? And there's risk in any company that would be known only to the CFO and a few other execs, around accounting items. Think Enron or Nortel. You would not necessarily know it."

It sounds nothing remotely like him - and I've just left a comment to that effect below the video. Haven't listened to it but it sounds more like Almeida's territory - could it be? If that’s Segovia, then I’m the Jolly Green Giant. Nor is it Laurindo Almeida – the song is “Laura,” from the film of the same name. Laurindo taught me that song many years ago when I was living in California in the seventies, and it was a completely different arrangement – way better I should add. That arrangement can be found in a terrific book of Laurindo’s arrangements of popular, Broadway, and old standards. The book is entitled “Contemporary Moods for Classical Guitar."" It is actually available on Amazon.
Many people don’t know that Laurindo started out as a classical guitarist, and was a very good one too. Somewhere I have an old LP of him playing all classical guitar music.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks inched lower Friday as bond yields jumped, a shift that helped banks but hurt companies that pay big dividends. The dollar fell after President Donald Trump said China is manipulating its currency.
Companies including Microsoft and Honeywell rose as investors were pleased with their quarterly reports, but General Electric stumbled. Stocks wobbled all week as investors reacted to solid company results as well as heightened trade tensions. The S&P 500 index was virtually flat for the week while the Russell 2000 index, which is made up of smaller companies that do more business inside the U.S., rose 0.6 percent.
In the last two days Trump criticized the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates and said China, said he's willing to put tariffs on all U.S. imports from China, and said China, the European Union and others are harming the U.S. by weakening their currencies and reducing interest rates. Stocks weren't affected, but the dollar declined and short-term bond yields slipped, suggesting investors wondered if the Fed might raise interest rates more slowly.
""If there's a toss-up between raising and not raising (rates), you wonder what role these types of comments might possibly play,"" said Sameer Samana, a strategist for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
Samana said he doesn't think the Fed will make big changes to its policies based on Trump's comments, even if the president starts advocating more forcefully for lower rates. But it's something investors will have to think about.
""We think the Fed has independence and they'll continue to do the right thing,"" he said. ""This is one more item that just creates noise in markets.""
The S&P 500 index dipped 2.66 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,801.83. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 6.38 points to 25,058.12. The Nasdaq composite gave up 5.10 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,820.20. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 4.50 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,696.81.
Short-term bond yields inched higher. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note rose to 2.60 percent from 2.59 percent.
Long-term bond prices dropped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.90 percent from 2.85 percent. That helped banks because bond yields are used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans including mortgages. JPMorgan Chase gained 1.3 percent to $111.28 and Bank of America picked up 1.6 percent to $30.13.
The dollar dropped sharply, to 111.52 yen from 112.46 yen. The euro rose to $1.1726 from $1.1644.
Microsoft continued to set records after its fiscal fourth-quarter results topped Wall Street forecasts and its cloud computing division continued to grow. The company said it's being helped by its rivalry with Amazon, because some retailers are reluctant to team up with Amazon on cloud computing services while they compete with Amazon in sales. The stock climbed 1.8 percent to $106.27.
General Electric lost 4.4 percent to $13.12 after it said its power business continued to struggle as revenue and orders decreased. GE, which has been selling and splitting off businesses, also cut its forecast for how much cash its businesses will generate.
In a taped interview with CNBC, Trump said ""I'm willing to go to 500,"" referring roughly to the $505.5 billion in goods the U.S. imported last year from China. Earlier this month the U.S. placed import taxes on $34 billion in goods imported from China and Beijing responded in kind. The Trump administration is considering tariffs on another $200 billion in goods.
The dispute between the world's two largest economies stems from accusations that China steals technology from U.S. companies or forces them to hand over technology to Chinese companies as well as differences over the U.S. trade deficit with China. Investors have worried that the trade war and other disputes involving the U.S. could slow down the global economy.
The People's Bank of China weakened the country's currency against the dollar on Friday. If the yuan continues to depreciate, goods exported to China will become more expensive to consumers there and Chinese exports would also be relatively cheaper. That could balance out suggested increases in tariffs by the Trump Administration.
The yuan has been skidding since February, mostly because of slower economic growth in China and rising interest rates in the U.S.
Benchmark U.S. crude added 1.4 percent to $70.46 a barrel in New York and Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 0.7 percent to $73.07 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline rose 1.2 percent to $2.07 a gallon. Heating oil edged up 0.7 percent to $2.10 a gallon. Natural gas lost 0.4 percent to $2.76 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold rose 0.6 percent to $1,231.10 an ounce. Silver gained 1 percent to $15.55 an ounce. Copper jumped 2.2 percent to $2.76 a pound.
Germany's DAX lost 1 percent and France's CAC 40 slid 0.3 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 gave up 0.1 percent. South Korea's Kospi added 0.3 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.8 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 percent.

Get Answers.,"Supposing I have an unfair coin (not 50/50), but don't know the probability of it landing on heads or tails, is there a standard formula/method for how many flips I should make before assuming that the distribution is about right?",2018-07-21T23:22:00.000+03:00,discussions,US,33,GregHullender,"When I was a principal research scientist at Amazon, I think the commonest question I got was of the form ""My test results showed 30 successes out of 40 attempts, so I want to say it was 75% successful, but my boss wants to know how confident we are of that measure. How do I compute that?"" Your problem testing a coin for fairness is just a special case of it.
To answer them, I'd first ask what sort of confidence interval they wanted. 95% is about the minimum reasonable, with 99% or higher being safer. (There are lots of factors that can complicate the problem, but let's keep it simple.)
Let A = 30 (the number of successes), let B = 10 (the number of failures) and let C = 0.99 for a 99% confidence interval. Then you compute two numbers as follows (I'll use the Microsoft Excel formula).
beta.inv((1 - C)/2, A + 0.5, B + 0.5) = 55.2%
beta.inv((1 + C)/2, A + 0.5, B + 0.5) = 89.2%
""Okay, tell your boss that you're 99% confident it's between 55.2% and 89.2% successful.""
If they said, ""Gee, that's too wide a gap: 33.9%,"" I'd tell them, ""You can shrink it by collecting more data, but it's quadratic in the limit, so if you want to cut the gap in half, you'll need four times as many samples.""
In this case, if A = 120 and B = 40 (multiplying both by 4) we'd shrink the interval to 66.5% to 83.0%, and, sure enough, the new gap of 17.5% is just about half the first one.
Only rarely did anyone actually want to know why this works. Most people were just really happy to have something to use that someone signed off on. But for those who do want to understand it better, I strongly recommend "" Interval Estimation for a Binomial Proportion ,"" (Lawrence D. Brown, T. Tony Cai and Anirban DasGupta; Statistical Science 2001 , Vol. 16, No. 2, 101–133). The formula I'm using above is the Jeffrey's interval, but there are other ways to do it."

I have never been one to sit on the sidelines.
A decade or more ago, I attended so many round tables and discussions that sounded the alarm for a real skills shortage in the tech sector. Without skills how could the industry grow?
So, we reached out to see how we could help. We worked with schools in Trafford to develop tech qualifications. This has evolved over the past decade to include courses, teaching teachers, installing tech suites (Raspberry Pi cafes) in schools and youth centres, and getting as many kids through the doors at UKFast Campus as possible. We even helped to change the curriculum. We currently have 75 apprentices and are recruiting more as we speak. Nowadays, I’m not worried about the skills gap anymore. It’s reassuring to see that we’re certainly not the only business to have got out there to boost tech education.
Yes, there are still many people sitting around talking about the problem, but I believe you have to get out there and make your mark. It doesn’t matter how small you are, when we ventured into the community, there were less than 30 people in the whole company. The schools we work with in Trafford now produce double the technically qualified students than those in Manchester and Salford, so we have first-hand experience of just what is possible when everyone gets behind an initiative. Deeper pockets and bigger funds
Nowadays, there is a much bigger issue that compounds and actually dwarfs the skills shortage. It’s a topic I have been very vocal about. For a number of years I have openly complained about it not being a level playing field with AWS and Azure having significant tax benefits. It’s a huge problem that puts hardworking UK companies at a colossal disadvantage.
The damage done to the high street particularly by Amazon and AWS has yet to really take its toll. We are just seeing the tip of the iceberg. But, in spite of incredible efforts to raise the issue at a senior government level, there has been a great deal of rhetoric, but no real action.
I even went to the lengths of joining the Leaders Group for the Conservative Party. I hoped that a seat at the table opposite the Prime Minister, Chancellor and other significant politicians may actually add weight to our plea. Somehow, no matter how it is tabled, regardless of the billions of uncollected revenue they are missing, the government is immovable. Changing business landscapes
When you exhaust all possibilities of levelling the playing field, you are left with few choices.
1. Give up and walk away, which I make no apology to my competitors, is not an option!
2. Set up offshore like AWS and pay revenue in a tax “efficient” way. That means no revenue is attributed to the UK, despite every penny of it coming from UK customers. This is not an option for me either. Despite of cynics like Owen Jones, who believe all businesses and business owners are bad, I am proud to contribute to this great country of ours.
3. Get stuck in and compete harder.
The third option is much more appealing and aligned with the type of competitive person I am. However, whichever strategy I look at, it all comes down to needing deeper pockets. After all, it’s a huge market and we are up against companies with very deep pockets who not only don’t pay tax, they seem to acquire huge contracts from the government too.
To expand ambitiously is going to require big funds. So, however I look at it, if we want to grow at pace and take on these US giants, which I do, we have to do something about it.
Interestingly, our cloud is growing at around 43%, which is the same rate as that of AWS. However, the significant difference AWS has with its market share means that we will always be falling further behind AWS when growing at the same percentage. The old UKFast office – back when there were just a handful of us on the team.
I still remember our very first customer at UKFast, a lady called Bridget Postlethwaite. She paid us £19.95 + vat a month, a whopping £239.40 for the year. I will never forget how excited we were and what a significant moment it was. It signified we were in business. We both walked to the Natwest to proudly bank the cheque. ClearCloud
Almost 19 years on from that momentous day, we announced the launch of a new startup this week, ClearCloud . A subsidiary of UKFast dedicated to supporting businesses with a multi-cloud strategy. It puts it in to perspective just how the market has grown when our first ClearCloud customer signed a deal for £250,000 per year. More than 1000 times the size of our very first customer.
When we started we were focussed on web development and shared hosting. Now our focus is very much on infrastructure and cloud. That being said, one thing that has never changed is our focus on support. And that’s what we are concentrating our efforts on with ClearCloud. Whenever you look at a business that has been around long enough to evolve with its industry, you will see the product change dramatically. But there is always a common thread that remains no matter how much the product evolves. What remains throughout every iteration of our UKFast journey, is service. It’s the reason we were inspired to set up in the first place. It is our differentiator in the marketplace. People are quite simply at the heart of all we do. No matter what service we provide, we’ll always do what we can to make our clients’ lives easier.
Whilst most of our competitors are happy to promote themselves as good at support, fortunately for us, they don’t have our passion, obsession or systems to deliver.
With AWS and Azure interested in growing their technical revenue, they rely on others to provide the service, so there is a huge gap in the market. Watch this space
So what’s next? I always envisaged growing UKFast into a business that would one day become a PLC. Interestingly, in the early years, when I shared this ambition with our accountants and advisors, they would tell me that I wasn’t cut out for it, that it wouldn’t sit well with me. However, over the years, a great deal has changed. In particular I have had to adapt my management style as the business grew and grew. Some might say I’ve become more mellow. I think I am just as passionate, but I am certainly a great deal more patient. I also spent years searching out the ingredients in the great leaders across the globe. One of the biggest factors that kept coming up was the importance of listening. “Two ears, one mouth,” as Tom Bloxham of Urban Splash used to tell me!
Floating UKFast now feels like an exciting prospect. It’s almost a necessity if I am going to take on the challenge of tackling and competing with global PLCs.
UKFast has such potential and, without doubt, can become the UK’s equivalent to Azure and AWS.
It’s a huge task and we have an immense amount of work to do but as, Tony Robbins said: “In nature nothing stands still. You are either growing or dying.”
Well, dying is not an option. If you are going to grow, you may as well aim high and shoot for the stars. Growing pains
So what’s around the corner? Well it’s Sunday and all I can say is I can’t wait to get into work tomorrow.
Over the years I have spent my entire life learning how to deal with the growing pains and coming to terms with just how to run UKFast as it morphs into different sizes. Just as I feel like I have a handle on things, it grows again and so the challenge continues.
It’s what makes being in business so much fun. It’s important too because as a leader it’s our role to ensure we inspire everyone around us. If we are not excited about the opportunities and prospects ahead, then how are your team supposed to get energised?
This is definitely the most exciting era of my business career. When you consider the resources we had as a tiny start up in 1999, just me Gail and Neil , and compare that to the resources and opportunities we have now, its a different world, a different planet! It’s a universe of potential."

**The posts I write might contain affiliate links or be written in collaboration with businesses or brands. Please see my disclosure policy for more information.** So why are second languages so important? Because we want not only want the best education for our children, we also live in a diverse world of many, many unique languages. But, what can parents do when only 25% of U.S. elementary schools, public or private, offer any type of foreign language programs? Invest in some amazing books! Here are two new English/French picture books for Kids that have recently crossed my desk: Bonjour! Let’s Learn French by Judy Martialay is a fun and easy introduction to French for children roughly 6-10.
“This book is meant to be used by parents with their kids, whether or not they know French,” Judy shared. “It’s a great chance to give kids an early start learning a language, and for parents to learn or review some French and enjoy the experience with their children.”
The audio version is free and downloadable at the website.
Bonjour! … is different from other books that teach a language. It begins with a story. Children board Pete the Pilot’s magic airplane en route to France. There, they learn some basic French. When they arrive, they meet Louis l’escargot, France’s popular snail, follow his adventure, meet his friends, absorb the culture, and learn French. When they “return home’, kids have lots of activities designed to encourage them to use their French with family and friends, including a treasure hunt, daily expression, a skit, Culture Corner, a song, and directions for making an impressionist picture. Author Judy Martialay
Bonjour! …is the sister book of the award-winning ¡HOLA! Let’s Learn Spanish , published in 2015. This book is also available for reviews. Bonjour!… is available in print on Amazon and B&N online, and in Kindle on Amazon. The print book was published October 31, 2017. Judy is a retired French and Spanish teacher who is also a member of the Public Advocacy Committee of the New York State Association of Foreign Language Teachers, National Network for Early Language Learning, among other language organizations. She is also a member of SCBWI and IBPA. Connect with Judy on her website and grab a copy of Bonjour! on Amazon , Kindle or B&N. A Walk in Nature, Une Promenade en Nature by Jesica Nkouaga After ten years of collecting drawings, Jesica came up with a way to put all of the things she loves together. She put the nature drawings together to create a basic language learning book for children. As an ESL teacher, language teaching and learning are something that Jesica does daily, so it made sense to create a book about language learning for children. Learn and practice basic French vocabulary and sentences through charming illustrations in this picture dictionary. Comprehension questions, matching activities, and pronunciation notes are included .
French connects with Jesica’s love for learning new languages, and it is one of her lifetime goals to learn French— the native language of her husband who is from Cameroon. By including a French translation in her book, it not only helps her learn and practice French, but it aids others who are learning and practicing French especially children! She is grateful to her husband, Abel, who enthusiastically and patiently helped to translate the book into French.
It is Jesica’s hope that children and parents will be inspired by the colorful and vibrant drawings of nature depicting different settings around the world, and hopefully, some French can be learned along the way. In this book, enjoy learning French and enjoy a walk in nature— une promenade en nature! Related Posts"

(CNN) × These Foods Linked to Ongoing Outbreaks Might Make You Sick US health officials are urging people to eat with caution in response to a string of ongoing outbreaks of intestinal infection. (CNN)
US health officials are warning people to avoid certain foods due to ongoing unrelated outbreaks of intestinal infections caused by bacteria, viruses and even parasites lurking in some of our food.
Here’s what to stay away from: Pasta salad
Hy-Vee, a Midwestern grocery store chain, has recalled a pasta salad that might be linked to at least 20 people getting sick from salmonella. Hy-Vee, based in Iowa, sold the 1-pound and 3-pound plastic containers of Spring Pasta Salad in eight states.
The states are Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota — where the salmonella illnesses were reported — and Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Wisconsin.
The product was produced between June 1 and July 13. The packages have expiration dates between June 22 and August 3.
Symptoms of salmonella begin 12 to 72 hours after a person is infected and include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramping. This can last about four to seven days, and most individuals recover without treatment. However, those who develop severe diarrhea may need to be hospitalized. Those who are very young, who are very old or who have compromised immune systems are most at risk for complications and severe cases of illness. Raw turkey
Salmonella is the culprit in 90 illnesses linked to raw turkey products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Agriculture.
The illnesses have been reported in 26 states since November. But health officials have not identified a brand, product or supplier as the source of the outbreak.
Patients who have been interviewed reported eating “different types and brands of turkey products purchased from many different locations. Two ill people lived in a household where raw turkey pet food was fed to pets,” the CDC said.
In addition, samples of raw turkey pet food, raw turkey products and live turkeys have tested positive for the outbreak strain of salmonella, which could mean the outbreak is “widespread in the turkey industry,” the CDC said. Cut melon
Put down the fork and step away from cut melon or fruit salad mixes that contain it.
The US Food and Drug Administration is warning people in 23 states that the fruit may be contaminated with salmonella.
The outbreak has affected 60 people mostly in five Midwestern states, with about half of them hospitalized.
Cut watermelon, honeydew and cantaloupe as well as fruit salads containing these melons have been recalled in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
The fruits were sold in stores such as Walmart, Kroger, Walgreens, Sprouts Farmers Market, Costco and Whole Foods/Amazon. Kellogg’s Honey Smacks cereal
Federal health officials want you to toss out all boxes of Kellogg’s Honey Smacks. The warning is due to an outbreak of salmonella that has left 100 people sick in 33 states .
The cereal was recalled June 14, but one month later, another warning not to eat the cereal was issued after the FDA said it was aware that it was still available.
“Retailers cannot legally offer the cereal for sale and consumers should not purchase Kellogg’s Honey Smacks cereal,” the agency said. Swiss rolls
Flowers Foods announced a recall of Swiss rolls because they may be contaminated with salmonella. The ingredient whey powder was recalled for possible contamination. There have been no reports of illness from Swiss rolls, according to the company.
Swiss rolls sold nationwide under the brand names Mrs. Freshley’s, Food Lion, H-E-B, Baker’s Treat, Market Square, and Great Value have been recalled. Captain John Derst’s Old Fashioned Bread distributed in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina have also been recalled, the company said. Ritz Cracker Sandwiches
Mondelēz Global LLC announced a voluntary recall of certain Ritz Cracker Sandwiches and other Ritz Bits products because they contain whey powder that has been recalled for possible salmonella contamination. The products are available nationwide.
The voluntary recall is a precaution, as no complaints of illness have been reported, the company said.
The recalled product list includes Ritz Bits cheese cracker sandwiches and mixed cookie and cracker variety packs. McDonald’s salads
As a precaution, McDonald’s has stopped selling salads in 3,000 locations in 14 states to try to contain an outbreak of cyclospora illness.
The states no longer selling these salads are Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Kentucky, West Virginia and Missouri.
To date, 163 cases have been confirmed in 10 states since May 1, according to the CDC .
The cyclospora parasite causes intestinal illness as a result of consuming contaminated food or water. Symptoms can begin a week or more after consuming the parasite. They include diarrhea and frequent, sometimes explosive bowel movements, according to the CDC. Those who are infected might also experience loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps or pain, nausea, gas and fatigue. Vomiting, headache, fever, body aches and flu-like symptoms can also occur.
The illness can last from a few days to a few months, and patients might feel better but then get worse again. Patients can be treated with antibiotics. Vegetable trays
Before you grab something off that vegetable tray, make sure it hasn’t been recalled.
The FDA is investigating at least 237 cases of cyclospora illnesses linked to recalled Del Monte Fresh vegetable trays . The trays contained broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and dill dip, and they were sold in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana.
“FDA has not identified which of the ingredients is the vehicle for this outbreak; each component of these vegetable trays is under consideration,” the agency said.
Cyclospora cayetanensis is a microscopic parasite that contaminates food or water and, when ingested, causes an intestinal illness. Symptoms include diarrhea, with sometimes explosive bowel movements, loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps, bloating, nausea and fatigue. Imported crab meat
Avoid eating fresh crab meat from Venezuela. That’s the advice from the FDA due to an outbreak of Vibrio parahaemolyticus that started in April. In all, 12 illnesses have been reported in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Louisiana and the District of Columbia.
“This product is commonly found in plastic tubs and may be labeled as ‘pre-cooked,’” the FDA said in its outbreak announcement .
Symptoms usually begin 24 hours after consuming the bacteria. They include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, fever and abdominal pain. Twelve people have become sick.

It always warms my heart when I see historic stories from our past re-told in fun and modern ways. I especially adore stories that reveal fun stories about this Nation’s leaders that prove that Presidents are people too! That is exactly what the charming picture book, Old Whiskers Escapes! does.
Did you know that President Benjamin Harrison had a pet goat named Old Whiskers that lived on the White House grounds? The Harrison grandchildren pose for a photo with Old Whiskers. NATIONAL JOURNAL
The goat often was spotted taking the president’s grandchildren on wagon rides on the lawn-which the grandkids obviously loved. The Old Whiskers Escapes! tale is actually inspired by a real-life conundrum; the day Old Whiskers escaped with Grandson Baby McKee in tow.
Can you imagine this combination of panic and hilarity? Obviously, this fiasco would be impossible in today’s age of Secret Service staffing and presidential security.
Upon discovering the pet goat was missing, President Harrison went running down Pennsylvania Avenue in hot pursuit, his top hat in one hand and cane in the other.
The story, delightful in its own right, will offer readers surprising insight into the popularity of presidential pets at the White House during the 19th Century, and the enduring relationships between grandparents and their grandchildren, even when “grandpa” is running the country.
“Uh-oh! When the clock struck 2, Baby McKee jumped with glee. It was time for the afternoon wagon ride on the White House lawn. The cart was ready. Old Whiskers was ready. But where was Grandpa?”
Written by Donna Griffin and illustrated by Gary Varvel, the book includes four pages of rich historical sidebars, including primary sources documenting the great goat caper, fun facts about presidential pets, and information about the Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site in Indianapolis, a museum home that tells the life story of America’s centennial president.
This picture book is suitable for ages 4-7 and can be found on Amazon . Something To Do
Learn all about President Benjamin Harrison
President Harrison was the 23rd commander-in-chief of the United States and was a grandson of the ninth president, William Henry Harrison , creating the only grandfather-grandson duo to have held the office. Harrison was a forward thinker, a great orator, a lifelong scholar, and a truly brilliant man. Harrison addressed immigration issues and opened Ellis Island, dealt decisively with crisis and the environment, and calmed unrest overseas. He was a respected Civil War General, a man whose ethics were beyond reproach, and a Progressive who ushered in the modern presidency. The State of Indiana proudly claims him as Indiana’s only president!

The Week in Review is a collection of both all the goodness I’ve written during the past week around the internet, as well as a small pile of links I found interesting – generally endurance sports related. I’ve often wondered what to do with all of the coolness that people write, and while I share a lot of it on Twitter and Facebook , this is a better forum for sending it on to y’all. Most times these different streams don’t overlap, so be on the lookout at all these places for good stuff!
So with that, let’s get into the action!
DCRAINMAKER.com Posts in the Past Week: Here’s all the goodness that ended up on the main page of DCRainmaker.com this past week:
Saturday: Wahoo KICKR 2018 Trainer In-Depth Review
Wednesday: Bontrager Flare RT & Ion 200 RT Connected Bike Lights In-Depth Review
Monday: Amazon Prime Day’s Sports Tech Deals (US and Europe)
And…to give you a bit of a preview till the end of the month, here’s what’s on the near-term radar: Suunto 9 In-Depth Review, Scosche 24 In-Depth Review, plus Eurobike leftover coverage of aero sensors, the Lezyne Mega C and XL units, and a more detailed post of my Stelvio ride outlined in the video below. Oh, and of course – the Annual DCR Eurobike RV Tour!!! Plus whatever else I stick in there like the Wahoo CLIMB In-Depth Review soon likely too! Glad to be done travelling till September (!), and back to knocking out things.
YouTube Videos I Made This Week: Here’s what hit the tubes over on the You of Tube, definitely don’t forget to subscribe there to get notified of videos the second they hit!
(Actually, I published a crapton on YouTube these past two weeks – so instead of putting all the videos here, hit up the link above to see them all, or, my favs below)
Again, I’ve released some 15 videos in the last two weeks – so definitely hit up the YouTube videos landing page for all the goodness! And of course whack that subscribe button – slowly closing in on 100,000 YouTube subscribers (thus allowing me to do an entirely unique unboxing !)
Stuff that I found interesting around the interwebs: Here’s a not-so-small smattering of all the random things that I stumbled on while doing my civic duty to find the end of the Internet.
1) There’s a Tour de France video game: And apparently it really sucks. Neat to see this article written by someone who seems to be a legit cycling fan.
2) Looking to build a new fitness device/startup? Read this: There’s no better person in this space to ask about the successes and failures of that than Eric, the CEO of Pebble. He put together a solid piece on this, worthy of a quick read.
3) Nikon appears to have discontinued making 360° cameras: No surprise here. Nikon’s mostly dismal software was really this camera’s major downfall, along with the fact that both GoPro and Garmin quickly more than doubled the resolution of their 360° cameras, leaving Nikon in an odd spot. Also, 360° video is still confusing for most people.
4) Polar in hot water over leaks of private data : This is actually unlike the Strava incident, in that this showed more information than it should have. Whereas Strava showed information that you told it to show (even if you didn’t realize the impacts of what you were doing). Polar issued a statement here and has made fixes .
5) Upcoming tariffs could impact Fitbit and other wearables: One thing to keep in mind on this though, is that there’s wide latitude as to how tariffs are applied within a given device. Meaning, it’s not just a 10% or 15% penalty on retail, but rather subcomponents of devices can be tariffed, making the effective tariff much lower in reality.
6) Consumer wearables increasingly being used in clinical trials: No surprise here, a quick overview of some of the major studies and how the tech works (via Mike B. )
7) Golden Cheetah being used by Tour de France teams: Lest you think it’s all sponsored usages of TrainingPeaks and Today’s Plan, open source cycling analytics software Golden Cheetah is also used. (via Brian L.)
8) Dynastream quietly renames itself ‘Garmin Canada’ : A message was sent to various ANT+ members, but you’ll notice the change at the bottom of the ANT+ page. Personally, I think this is a mistake. At least with the Dynastream corporate branding, they appeared more as non-Garmin than Garmin (ANT+ employees work in a bit of a silo compared to Garmin employees – given they were a wholly owned subsidiary). But this branding essentially reminds non-Garmin ANT+ members (of which there are hundreds of companies) that ‘At the end of the day, you’re still competing with Garmin’. While that was certainly true prior to the rename, at least it wasn’t in your face. Just my two cents.
Sports Technology Software/Firmware Updates This Week: Each week I quickly highlight some of the new firmware, app, software and website service updates that I see go out. If you’re a sports technology company and release an update – shoot me a quick note (just one-liners are perfect, or Tweet it at me is even better) and I’ll make mention of it here. If I don’t know about it, I won’t be able to post about it. Sound good? Oh – and if you want to get a head start on things, this page is a great resource for watching Garmin firmware updates .
Garmin FR935 BETA firmware update: Just minor updates.
…and, apparently that’s it for updates this week. Slow week, guess all the devs are watching Le Tour!

Here We Go Again at the Apollo in Hammersmith, London, Britain
By Rebecca Rubin
LOS ANGELES ( Variety.com ) - In a twist ending straight out of a movie, ""The Equalizer 2"" shot past ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again' to steal the box office crown.
Going into the weekend, it looked like ""Mamma Mia! 2"" would easily debut at No. 1. Final numbers won't come in until Monday, but weekend estimates show Sony's ""The Equalizer"" sequel opened above estimates with $35.8 million when it launched in 3,388 locations, while Universal's highly anticipated follow-up to ""Mamma Mia!"" debuted with $34.4 million from 3,317 screens.
""Equalizer 2,"" the first sequel of Denzel Washington's nearly four-decade long career, launched ahead of its predecessor. 2014's ""The Equalizer"" opened with $35 million and went on to generate $192 million worldwide, including $101 million domestically.
Antoine Fuqua returned to direct ""The Equalizer 2,"" which also stars Pedro Pascal, Ashton Sanders, Melissa Leo, and Bill Pullman. Though it got a head start on the original film, reception has been less enthusiastic for the sequel, which currently holds a tepid 50 percent average on Rotten Tomatoes.
Though ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again"" couldn't dance its way to the top of the domestic box office, its $34 million opening is still a win. The original ""Mamma Mia!"" hit theatres a decade ago with $27 million. It became a box office hit, amassing $615 million worldwide on a $52 million budget. Much like the first film, the sequel will likely be a smash overseas, where Swedish pop group ABBA has a huge following.
Much of the star-studded cast -- including Amanda Seyfried, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard, Colin Firth, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, and Dominic Cooper -- returned for the second film. Lily James made her debut as a the younger version of Meryl Streep's charming and carefree Donna, while living legend Cher also joined the cast. Ol Parker, the screenwriter behind ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"" took over directing duties and penned the script.
The final wide release of the weekend, BH Tilt's ""Unfriended: Dark Web,"" got off to a scary start. The low-budget horror film debuted way below projections with $3.5 million from 1,546 locations. That might not matter, considering the Blumhouse title carries a $1 million price tag. ""Dark Web"" is a standalone sequel to 2015's ""Unfriended."" That film became a cash cow, opening with $15 million and going on to earn $64 million from a $41 million budget.
""The Grudge"" and ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" writer Stephen Susco made his directorial debut with ""Dark Web,"" which features Colin Woodell, Rebecca Rittenhouse, Betty Gabriel, and Andrew Lees.
Among holdovers, ""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" nabbed third place during its second outing. Sony's animated sequel picked up another $23 million from 4,267 locations, bringing its domestic tally to $91 million.
In fourth, Marvel's ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" pocketed $16 million from 3,778 screens in its third frame. In total, the Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily-led superhero blockbuster has made $165 million.
Disney-Pixar's ""Incredibles 2"" rounded out the top five with $11.3 million. In six weeks, the animated sequel has earned a massive $557 million in North America.
Meanwhile, Dwayne Johnson's ""Skyscraper"" continues to struggle in North America. Universal's action adventure dropped 56% in its sophomore weekend, collecting $11 million in 3,822 locations. The studio is hoping for massive returns internationally, where it opens this weekend in China.
At the speciality box office, Lionsgate's ""Blindspotting"" bowed with $332,500 when it opened in 14 theatres. That's a solid per-screen-average of $23,750. Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal co-wrote and star in ""Blindspotting, which debuted to raves at this year's Sundance Film Festival.
Bleecker Street's ""McQueen,"" a documentary chronicling the life of iconic fashion designer Alexander McQueen, landed the top theatre average of the weekend with $24,232. It scored $96,928 when it opened in four theatres.
Another new offering, Amazon Studios' ""Generation Wealth,"" bowed on four screens with $33,602 for a per-theatre-average of $8,401. More From Entertainment "

Book is only about 400 pages (minus index and the rest).
Add-Ons To Convince (Trick) You
The book has interior color that is completely useless in an attempt to justify the price.
It doesn't.
Interesting Also : Online Price
Now, since I'm a Prime member I can get that book in 2 days for $47.99. That's $22!
B&N will ship it to me in a couple of days for $59.03 undercutting their own store but still can't beat Amazon. Not sure why they can't/don't.
B&N has to figure something out or Amazon is going to destroy them.
Tech Books Are Way Too Expensive
The latest C# In A Nutshell 7.0 book [ ^ ] is $74.99 at the local store.
And, it doesn't have any color printing.
EDIT
Also interesting and somewhat related is that I notice that Packt Publishing is literally flooding the tech book market. I've read a number of their books in the past and they always fall flat.
I won't even begin to read a Packt book now. They even changed their design (I believe so you wouldn't recognize the books are by them).
I am a SafariBooks online member and every book that comes out is available there very fast.

Another on of Robert Kirkman’s comic creations will be coming to a screen near you.
The Walking Dead creator announced that his comic series Super Dinosaur will be getting adapted into an animated series, at the Skybound Entertainment panel Friday night at Comic-Con International in San Diego . The series was created by Kirkman and artist Jason Howard, and was first published by Image Comics in 2011.
Super Dinosaur focuses on the adventures of 10-year-old genius Derek Dynamo and his best friend Super Dinosaur, a nine-foot tall Tyrannosaurus Rex who loves to play video games. The dino suits up in a variety of exoskeletons that are made in such a way that allow his shorter arms to control much larger ones, often fitted with missiles, lasers, and all the tools necessary to help take down evildoers. The pair work to protect Inner-Earth, where SD originated and other sentient dinosaurs live, from Max Maximus, who wants to use the prehistoric creatures and DynOre (a mineral found only in that land) for nefarious reasons.

The family-friendly series is the latest of Kirkman’s creations to be brought from page to screen. With The Walking Dead approaching its ninth season, and his superhero comic Invincible being developed into an animated series with Amazon Studios, Kirkman’s stories are being brought to wider audiences than ever before. The animated version of Super Dinosaur will be sure to appeal to kids (and dinosaur-loving adults) of all ages, just as the comic series does. Tags:"

Shutterfly photo book quality is far superior to Snapfish/Amazon Photos.
The 8×11 is my go-to book, we make one for every trip we go on and it’s always stunningly awesome! I’d highly recommend getting the 8×11 size over the 8×8 size.
While the promotion calls it unlimited extra pages, there is actually a limit of 111 pages in a photo book.
A normal photo book only includes 20 pages. Each extra page normally costs $1.29-$2.29 each, so this represents a massive savings on photo books with lots of pages!
You can also upgrade to layflat pages for 40% off as well, which makes for an even more stunning photo book.
For example:
-If you order 2 hardcover 8×11 books with 111 pages in each book, you would normally pay: $39.99 per book +$144.69 for 111 extra pages at $1.59 per extra page. =$184.68/book or $369.36 for 2 books before any promotions. Even with a 50% off promotion, that’s a total of $184.68.
With this promotion you will pay: $39.99 per book with unlimited free pages Less 40%= $23.99 per book. That’s a total of $47.98 for 2 books, plus you’ll get free shipping and get 2 free luggage tags, a key ring, a pencil case, a reuseable bag, a pet bandanna, a notebook, and a deck of cards!
-If you order 1 Hardcover 11×14 book with 111 pages you’ll pay just $44.99 with free shipping and get 2 free luggage tags, a key ring, a pencil case, a reuseable bag, a pet bandanna, a notebook, and a deck of cards!

Here We Go Again at the Apollo in Hammersmith, London, Britain
By Rebecca Rubin
LOS ANGELES ( Variety.com ) - In a twist ending straight out of a movie, ""The Equalizer 2"" shot past ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again' to steal the box office crown.
Going into the weekend, it looked like ""Mamma Mia! 2"" would easily debut at No. 1. Final numbers won't come in until Monday, but weekend estimates show Sony's ""The Equalizer"" sequel opened above estimates with $35.8 million when it launched in 3,388 locations, while Universal's highly anticipated follow-up to ""Mamma Mia!"" debuted with $34.4 million from 3,317 screens.
""Equalizer 2,"" the first sequel of Denzel Washington's nearly four-decade long career, launched ahead of its predecessor. 2014's ""The Equalizer"" opened with $35 million and went on to generate $192 million worldwide, including $101 million domestically.
Antoine Fuqua returned to direct ""The Equalizer 2,"" which also stars Pedro Pascal, Ashton Sanders, Melissa Leo, and Bill Pullman. Though it got a head start on the original film, reception has been less enthusiastic for the sequel, which currently holds a tepid 50 percent average on Rotten Tomatoes.
Though ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again"" couldn't dance its way to the top of the domestic box office, its $34 million opening is still a win. The original ""Mamma Mia!"" hit theatres a decade ago with $27 million. It became a box office hit, amassing $615 million worldwide on a $52 million budget. Much like the first film, the sequel will likely be a smash overseas, where Swedish pop group ABBA has a huge following.
Much of the star-studded cast -- including Amanda Seyfried, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard, Colin Firth, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, and Dominic Cooper -- returned for the second film. Lily James made her debut as a the younger version of Meryl Streep's charming and carefree Donna, while living legend Cher also joined the cast. Ol Parker, the screenwriter behind ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"" took over directing duties and penned the script.
The final wide release of the weekend, BH Tilt's ""Unfriended: Dark Web,"" got off to a scary start. The low-budget horror film debuted way below projections with $3.5 million from 1,546 locations. That might not matter, considering the Blumhouse title carries a $1 million price tag. ""Dark Web"" is a standalone sequel to 2015's ""Unfriended."" That film became a cash cow, opening with $15 million and going on to earn $64 million from a $41 million budget.
""The Grudge"" and ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" writer Stephen Susco made his directorial debut with ""Dark Web,"" which features Colin Woodell, Rebecca Rittenhouse, Betty Gabriel, and Andrew Lees.
Among holdovers, ""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" nabbed third place during its second outing. Sony's animated sequel picked up another $23 million from 4,267 locations, bringing its domestic tally to $91 million.
In fourth, Marvel's ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" pocketed $16 million from 3,778 screens in its third frame. In total, the Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily-led superhero blockbuster has made $165 million.
Disney-Pixar's ""Incredibles 2"" rounded out the top five with $11.3 million. In six weeks, the animated sequel has earned a massive $557 million in North America.
Meanwhile, Dwayne Johnson's ""Skyscraper"" continues to struggle in North America. Universal's action adventure dropped 56% in its sophomore weekend, collecting $11 million in 3,822 locations. The studio is hoping for massive returns internationally, where it opens this weekend in China.
At the speciality box office, Lionsgate's ""Blindspotting"" bowed with $332,500 when it opened in 14 theatres. That's a solid per-screen-average of $23,750. Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal co-wrote and star in ""Blindspotting, which debuted to raves at this year's Sundance Film Festival.
Bleecker Street's ""McQueen,"" a documentary chronicling the life of iconic fashion designer Alexander McQueen, landed the top theatre average of the weekend with $24,232. It scored $96,928 when it opened in four theatres.
Another new offering, Amazon Studios' ""Generation Wealth,"" bowed on four screens with $33,602 for a per-theatre-average of $8,401. More From Entertainment "

Of the world’s 100 largest economies, 69 are transnational businesses. How can we control—and ultimately transform them? Corporation by Nick Youngson . CC BY-SA 3.0 Alpha Stock Images .
Transnational corporations have become the dominant force directing our world. Humanity is accelerating toward a precipice of overconsumption, and the large transnationals are the primary agents driving us there. We’re rapidly losing the earth’s forests , animals , insects , fish , even the topsoil we require to grow our crops. The earth is becoming denuded of its bounty as every living system ­is ransacked for resources—not to mention the looming emergency of climate breakdown. As a result, twenty thousand scientists have recently issued a public warning to humanity, while prominent academics consider the collapse of civilization this century to be a serious threat.
Changes in our personal consumption patterns are important, but are ultimately inconsequential compared with the impact of the transnationals that have come to dominate our global economic and political system. Of the world’s hundred largest economies, sixty-nine are now corporations . Political parties in many of our so-called democracies are funded in large part by billionaires, while government cabinet positions are staffed by corporate executives . International bodies setting global policy are infiltrated by corporate agents so successful at entrenching corporate power that even those governments that still prioritize their people’s needs can no longer make autonomous decisions without risking crippling lawsuits from the transnationals whose interests they threaten. Meanwhile, countries and cities compete with each other to beg their corporate overlords for investment dollars, even it means undermining public services and legal protections for their own populations.
Environmental groups, recognizing where ultimate power resides, try to pressure corporations to improve practices through the threat of public shaming, with some appreciable results . However, these attempts are necessarily constrained by the very structure of big corporations, which exist to enrich their shareholders regardless of the consequences. The common goal of corporations around the world is to monetize human activity and what’s left of nature’s abundance as rapidly and efficiently as possible. The overriding purpose of the world’s powerful institutional force is thus directly at odds with a flourishing earth or a viable future for humanity.
Having spent the first part of my career in the heart of the capitalist system, consulting to major international banks and corporations, I developed a sense of the underlying forces that direct the centers of financial power. These ideas are my distillation of what I believe could be effective levers for humanity to take back some control from the increasing hegemony of corporations and billionaires.
If we are to avoid disaster, our global economic system with its gaping inequities and deranged consumption will eventually need to dismantled and replaced by one based on life-affirming principles rather than wealth maximization. These suggestions, even in aggregate, wouldn’t do that. They represent mere tweaks in a system that ultimately needs to be completely transformed. But like a modest trim tab that helps redirect an ocean liner , perhaps they could begin to curb the destructive force of transnationals and redirect their enormous power toward a more sustainable path. 1. Triple bottom line required for corporate charters.
A fundamental reason for the rapacious behavior of transnational corporations is their drive to maximize shareholder value above anything else. While there is no explicit requirement for this in the standard corporate charter, a century of case law has entrenched this principle into the behavior of large corporations to the point that is has become the de facto standard of operation . As a result, if corporations were people, they would be considered psychopaths , utterly devoid of any caring for the harm they cause in the pursuit of their goals.
It is easier, however, to change a corporation’s values than those of a human psychopath. All you need to do is change the legal basis of their charter. Instead of pursuing shareholder interests alone, they could be re-chartered with the explicit purpose of achieving a triple bottom line of social and environmental outcomes as well as financial—sometimes known as the “triple Ps” of people, planet, and profit.
This alternative corporate value system is already available through chartering as a benefit corporation or certifying as a B-Corp , and has been adopted by over 2,000 corporations in over fifty countries around the world—including several multibillion-dollar transnationals . My proposal is that, instead of being a voluntary step taken by a select few, this would be a requirement for all corporations above a certain size.
Overnight, the intrinsic character of the corporation would be transformed. Currently, CEOs and corporate boards are faced with continual pressure to grow their earnings at all cost. If they chose to make a humane decision, such as not to exploit a copper mine because of the consequent pollution, they could expect to be sued by shareholders, and possibly acquired by a more ruthless competitor. However, if they were legally required to achieve a triple bottom line, they would weigh up decisions in a more balanced way, as a rational person might. With the board responsible for all three bottom lines, they would have to consider the risk of being sued if they caused excessive pollution, or if they were callous to the needs of the communities where their plants were located.
Currently, large corporations boast of their corporate social responsibility departments that are supposed to care about issues such as employment practices of their suppliers, sustainability of their raw materials, environmental impact of their packaging, gender balance and ethnic diversity in the workplace, and investments in local communities. Suddenly, they would have to stop paying mere lip service to these issues and take them as seriously as marketing costs, revenue growth and distribution channels—the things that CEOs actually worry about when they go home at night. 2. Charter renewal required every five years.
Changing the corporate charter requirement might not, however, be enough by itself to halt the relentless pursuit of profits by large transnationals. After all, executive pay packages consist of dollars rather than goodwill, and those dollars are linked directly to the share price, which is driven by shareholders’ expectation of financial returns. If they could get away with it, they might continue their rapacious practices, while trying harder to look like they’re meeting the other two bottom lines.
That’s the reason for my second proposal, which is to require that corporations, which currently enjoy what’s known legally as a “ perpetual existence ,” get their charters renewed every five years. If they failed to meet pre-established criteria on their two non-financial bottom lines, they would not be permitted to continue in business. Currently, if a company can’t meet its financial obligations, it’s forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and the value of its stock generally tanks to zero. Under my proposal, executives would also have to consider the risk of declaring “social bankruptcy” or “environmental bankruptcy” as they made their business decisions.
As in currently regulated industries such as banking, the final step of losing their charter would not have to be immediate. If a corporation failed to meet its basic parameters, it could be given a warning, with a time period set to fix things. However, the mere threat of this happening would lead corporate executives to make sure they were well above the criteria required to keep their charter.
Corporations are, of course, highly adept at using their financial resources to influence regulatory bodies through bribes and other mechanisms. To avoid this, panel members responsible to renew the charter would be representatives of the communities and ecosystems covered in the company’s scope of operations. Their task would be to weigh up the findings of experienced independent auditors on the company’s performance. To minimize corruption, the panel could be chosen by a process of random selection called sortition , just a like a trial jury is chosen in our legal system. 3. Tax stock trades based on the length of the holding period.
Powerful as they are, even corporations have their masters: their shareholders. But don’t think of the typical shareholder as a Warren Buffet type, sitting back in his leather armchair perusing his holdings. Instead, corporate stocks are subject to the frenetic activity of financial markets, where split-second computer algorithms govern much of the trading. Investment firms spend hundreds of millions of dollars enhancing their computing networks to shave as little as three milliseconds off the timing of their trades. The hyper liquidity of global markets means that investors are obsessed with short-term market trends, which leads corporate CEOs, forever anxious about their stock price, to focus their time horizon on the next quarterly earnings report. Financial valuations apply discount rates to future earnings, which means that an investment paying off thirty years in the future can be worth as little as five percent of its future payoff in the present. Under these conditions, why would any CEO care about the state of the planet—or even their company—thirty years from now?
During the 2016 US election campaign, Bernie Sanders proposed a Financial Transaction Tax to pay for free college tuition, setting the rate at 0.1% of the transaction. In Europe, discussions are under way to apply a similar EU-wide tax. My proposal increases the tax rate by orders of magnitude, and differentiates based on the length of the stock holding. For example, the tax rate might look like this:
- 10% if the stock is held less than a day
- 5% if less than a year
- 3% if less than 10 years
- 1% if less than 20 years
- Zero if more than 20 years
The effects of this single step would be enormous. The financial services industry would be transformed overnight. High frequency stock trading and same-day traders would disappear. The short-term orientation of the stock market would be replaced by carefully considered long-term investment decisions. A typical mutual fund, which in the US currently turns over its portfolio at the rate of 130% a year , could no longer afford to do so, and would have to change its investment decision-making based on sustainable returns. The tax could be waived for individuals experiencing a life-changing event or for simple hedging techniques where, for example, farmers need to lock in the price of their produce at a future time.
The result would be a massive shift away from destructive extractive industries and toward sustainable businesses. For example, the fossil fuel industry is recognized to be vastly overvalued as a result of its “ unburnable carbon ”: the amount of fossil fuels in the ground that can never be burned if the world is to keep climate change below the 2° rise agreed at COP21 in Paris. A recent study estimates the overvaluation as high as $4 trillion . Investors, however, play a game of musical chairs, hoping they won’t be the ones left holding the stranded assets. This proposed transaction fee would incent them to dump fossil fuel investments immediately for opportunities in renewable energy with longer-term payoffs. 4. Cap on billionaire’s assets over $5 billion.
As corporations have taken increasing control of the global system, they have catapulted founding shareholders and their heirs to previously unimaginable pinnacles of wealth. The combined wealth of the world’s 2,754 billionaires is now $9.2 trillion, an amount that has doubled in the past six years , and increased tenfold since the beginning of this century. The magnitude of this wealth is difficult to conceive. The top six billionaires own as much as the lower half of the entire world’s population. Taken together, the world’s billionaires would represent the third largest economy in the world, behind only China and the United States, with wealth equivalent to the GDP of Germany and Japan combined.
There is no legitimate rationale for this outrageous concentration of such wealth in a few individuals. The argument that the founders of Microsoft, Amazon, or Facebook deserve such excessive wealth is no more valid than the belief of the ancient Egyptians in the divinity of their Pharaoh, or the Medieval notion of the divine right of kings. Mark Zuckerberg, aged 33, currently owns over $70 billion. If someone had singlehandedly miniaturized the transistor, developed the logic for computer code, invented the PC, and come up with the internet, then maybe they’d deserve having close to that amount as a reward for the value they created. But all Zuckerberg did was figure out a way to connect people up in a network that became a bit more popular than other networks, and because of the internet’s scale effects, he was the lucky one who hit the jackpot. Zuckerberg merely took advantage of all the other infrastructure work that led to the internet, painstakingly pieced together by millions of people over decades, which has been the real value creator for the world.
In response to this excess, my proposal is to cap billionaires’ wealth at, say, $5 billion. It’s an arbitrary amount, still obscenely high and presumably more than enough for those who argue that people should receive ample financial rewards for success. Beyond a certain level of wealth, however, what drives these people is power and prestige. This could be tapped by requiring them to donate their excess wealth to a trust over which they could retain some influence.
Such a trust, however, would need to have some strict criteria. While the billionaire could influence the trust’s priorities, he would not have control over its activities. The current Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for example, while a step in the right direction, is under the total control of the Gateses and Warren Buffet. The foundation set up with much fanfare by Mark Zuckerberg is viewed by experts as little more than a fancy tax dodge .
Each trust would need to avoid interference in a country’s political system and be dedicated to life-affirming activities, the scope of which could be based, for example, on the principles of the Earth Charter , a framework for building a just, sustainable and peaceful global society endorsed by over 6,000 organizations.
The positive impact that these trillions of dollars could have on human and natural welfare would be prodigious. Imagine a country the size of Germany and Japan combined dedicated entirely to serving human and natural flourishing. It would have the resources to end extreme poverty , increase regenerative agriculture to over a billion acres worldwide, educate hundreds of millions of girls through the Global South, disseminate up to a billion clean cookstoves , and much, much more.
The billionaires of the world, meanwhile, would continue to enjoy enormous wealth, and when they jet to Davos to hobnob with other luminaries for the annual World Economic Forum, they could finally have something worthwhile to boast about. 5. Declare a crime of ecocide at the International Criminal Court.
Even with all these constraints, the powers of transnational corporations would remain enormous, and there would still be times when, through willful negligence or intentional bad faith, corporate action causes massive environmental damage. A UN study, which remained unpublished , found that the world’s largest companies had caused over $2 trillion of environmental damage, which would cost a third of their overall profits if they were forced to pay for it. Because of their extensive political influence, even their most damaging activities go unpunished. This leads to my final proposal: to declare a crime of ecocide at the International Criminal Court (ICC).
The ICC is an independent judicial body set up by international treaty, the Rome Statute, in 2002 to prosecute war crimes, genocides, and crimes against humanity. While it continues to face serious challenges to its enforcement powers, it has had the effect of putting tyrants everywhere on notice that they can no longer act with impunity. If ecocide—the loss, destruction, or severe damage of an ecosystem—were declared a crime by the ICC, this could have a similarly daunting effect on those corporate tyrants who currently know they can get away with devastating the world’s “sacrifice zones” where they are pillaging the earth’s resources for profit.
There is a campaign, Eradicating Ecocide , already under way to make this happen. A model law has been drafted, and an Earth Protectors Trust Fund has been set up to permit common people everywhere to become legal Earth protectors. If a two-thirds majority of the Rome Statute signatories were to approve this as an amendment, it would become enforceable globally. Suddenly, corporate boards and CEOs everywhere would realize they are no longer above the law.
There is a strange paradox to consider about these proposals. One the one hand, notice how limited they are in scope. Even if they were all implemented overnight, the global system would not be overturned. People would still go to work and get paid, food would still be on the shelves of the grocery store, the same governments would still be in power, and the internet would still work. The gaping structural inequities of our current world order would continue unabated, and we’d still be consuming far more than our planet can sustain. Ultimately, we need a complete transformation of our global system if our civilization is to survive intact through this century.
On the other hand, it doesn’t take a political genius to realize that these ideas are so far from mainstream thinking that they have virtually no chance to be adopted any time soon. They would be considered too radical for even the most progressive mainstream politician to endorse. What does this tell us about our current political dialogue? To me, it suggests that our conversations are too severely constrained by what we’re “allowed” to think in terms of how our system works. We need to cast our gaze outside the norms that our billionaire-controlled mainstream media permits us to consider.
Imagine a world where these ideas (or others like them) began to be seriously entertained. How would they even be enforced? The only way corporations could be brought to heel, or billionaires compelled to give up their excess billions, would be a concerted effort led by the United States in conjunction with the European Union, and joined by the preponderance of other countries.
This, of course, could only happen if grassroots demand for these ideas spread so powerfully that politicians had to take notice. This is not such an unrealistic scenario, given the worldwide disavowal of the dominant capitalist model: most Europeans have a higher opinion of socialism than capitalism, and even in the US, the overwhelming majority see big business as unethical and unfair .
Then, there is the potential “trim tab” effect of adopting these ideas. Even though these proposals alone wouldn’t fundamentally transform our system in the way that’s needed, they might set changes in motion that could eventually take us there. There may be other ideas more effective than these, and of course each proposal contains within it complications that would need to be worked out carefully. However, my hope is that these ideas invite a new mode of political dialogue, along with a recognition that even in the darkest times, realistic pathways exist toward a thriving future for humanity and the natural world.
When the Occupy movement failed to achieve its initial promise, many people pointed to its lack of specific demands as a reason for its demise. If and when the next radical grassroots movement emerges, which may be sooner than you expect , let’s make sure they have an array of ideas such as these in their quiver to focus public opinion on actual political deliverables.
There are very few people who really want to see our civilization collapse. If these proposals eventually did get implemented, perhaps even the executives of the transnational corporations might sleep better at night, knowing that they can become part of the solution rather than a force of destruction.

I slogged through the first mile of yesterday's 5K run. The weather was perfect for a run. There was a headwind but it was sunny and cool. The vista of Boston Harbor is stunning. Running from Carson Beach to U.Mass Boston and back is a route we've run for the past 3 years training for the Bermuda Half Marathon and one we love to run. It seemed as though I had the weight of the world on my shoulders. I wondered if I would ever get back to a faster pace knowing full well that:
We passed by JFK's sailboat and people had paused to look at the boat and the accompanying plaque.
Tom and I decided to pause for a moment and take a photo and read the plaque that we had run by countless times.
“I really don't know why it is that all of us are so committed to the sea, except I think it's because in addition to the fact that the sea changes, and the light changes, and ships change, it's because we all came from the sea. And it is an interesting biological fact that all of us have in our veins the exact same percentage of salt in our blood that exists in the ocean, and, therefore, we have salt in our blood, in our sweat, in our tears. We are tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea - whether it is to sail or to watch it - we are going back from whence we came.""
It helped me connect to something far greater than myself that is within me and all around me.
After the first mile, I knew I needed to get myself together on the run.
I cleared away the cobwebs of thoughts that were weighing me down.
I allowed myself to experience the expansiveness of the ocean and the infinite possibilities that exist reflecting on gratitude for my miraculous healing journey in the wake of childhood paralytic polio and trauma.
As I turned over my worries to the Universe, I felt lighter. The tightness in my chest released and I got very focused.
My pace went from 18:26 for mile 1 to 17:24 for mile 2 according to Tom's Garmin.
I felt a determination fire up in my soul as I get ready to run the 5th Annual Middlemiss Big Heart 5K Run, Walk, Roll on September 22.
It's an all pace race and I don't have to ""worry"" about my time. My goal after running Bermuda this year was to focus on shorter distances and my pace. My body has a lot of recovering to do after I challenged it to 3 consecutive half marathons in as many years and I honor that but I also feel passionate about not allowing external circumstances to impede my recovery efforts or stand between me and my goals. I felt compassion and self-love flow through me honoring the stress in our lives. I felt a shift within me and my pace picked up almost without effort.
When we finished our run
I felt transformed! I loved feeling the trickles of sweat that pooled in the small of my back and the sweat that mingled with tears of release and relief!
Tom looked at the pace of our final 1.1 miles - 17:11!!!
Talk about negative splits on a run but more than the time and the pace was a shift to feeling freedom and a renewed belief that I CAN set and achieve goals when I connect to Source.
I can trust in the process of recovery and I can allow myself to once again run free and unencumbered.
Feeling this fast pace ignited a sense of hope and joy within me as I cast out my troubles. I once again discovered that the cure for anything is saltwater, sweat, tears and the sea!
From my heart to yours,
To your health and wellness,
Mary

President Donald Trump lashed out at the European Union’s $5bn fine against Google over its mobile phone operating system in the latest trade-related salvo fired from the White House.
The escalating trade conflict between the US and EU surfaced in tense exchanges with NATO allies during Trump’s European visit last week. The two sides have been locked in a circle of tit-for-tat retaliation since Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and the EU retaliated with duties on a basket of goods.
Trump is now threatening to impose crippling levies on auto imports and the EU is readying another round of counter-measures.
“I told you so! The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies, Google. They truly have taken advantage of the US, but not for long!” Trump said in a Twitter posting on Thursday. I told you so! The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies, Google. They truly have taken advantage of the U.S., but not for long!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2018
Alphabet’s Google received a record €4.3bn antitrust fine from the EU on Wednesday and was ordered to change the way it puts search and web-browser apps onto Android mobile devices.
Google was given until mid-October to stop what the EU called “illegal practices” on contracts with handset manufacturers that push its services in front of users.
The company faces daily fines of 5% of revenue if it doesn’t obey.
The penalty – the same amount the Netherlands contributes to the EU budget every year – is far higher than any other dished out by the US, Chinese or other antitrust authorities.
The US is unlikely to match the European Union’s fine. Antitrust regulation is divvied up by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.
While new FTC chairperson Joseph Simons told Congress on Wednesday that the agency will review the EU findings closely, the same agency closed its own probe of Google years ago.
EU Antitrust Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s fine on Google comes just a year after slapping the company with a €2.4bn penalty for thwarting online shopping rivals.
It’s the latest in a series of EU strikes on Silicon Valley giants that also included hefty back tax bills for Apple and Amazon.com, accused of receiving unfair fiscal deals from EU nations.
The White House did not respond to requests for comment after the EU fine was announced on Wednesday.
Trump said on Wednesday he was looking forward to a July 25 visit by EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who is coming to the White House to discuss the trade relationship.
Trump, who is considering slapping tariffs on car imports from Europe, threatened “tremendous retribution” against the EU if the meeting at the White House doesn’t go well.
“If we don’t negotiate something fair, then we have tremendous retribution, which we don’t want to use, but we have tremendous powers,” Trump said Wednesday during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. “We have to. Including cars. Cars is the big one.”
For its part, the EU is preparing a new list of US goods to hit with retaliatory measures Trump moves ahead with the car tariffs.
“If the US would impose these car tariffs that would be very unfortunate, but we are preparing together with our member states a list of rebalancing measures as well,” EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom said on Thursday.
Juncker will bring two main negotiating proposals in an effort to tamp down the escalating trade tensions: an offer to discuss the reduction of levies on cars and car parts among all major auto-exporting countries, and the possibility of broaching a limited free-trade agreement, according to an official with knowledge of the EU’s thinking.
Trump frequently tweets on companies, sometimes moving their share prices in the process. Thursday’s Google message came hours after he thanked Swiss drugmaker Novatis and rival Pfizer for not raising prices on prescription drugs.

Author Bio: Bonnie Marlewski-Probert is an international bestselling author of both non-fiction and fictional works. She has authored more than 30 books and has worked in the horse industry as a teacher, trainer, speaker, writer and columnist for more than 20 years. She learned how powerful having horses in your life could be when she was a child. “I was one of four children raised in an Irish Catholic home in Illinois where my parents owned the only grocery store in the area. We lived in the same building as the store so it was not uncommon to have the town drunks stop by and bang on our kitchen window late at night to get one of us up so they could buy cigarettes on the way home. My upbringing was similar to farming families – crops and livestock come first and kids come somewhere around 4th or 10th on the list. In our family, customers came first because they paid the bills, like it or not! I learned early on that if I were to survive that upbringing, I had to become creative and thankfully, I was introduced to horses at an early age.

Wattles, you’ll learn what desire really is, what power it really has, and what’ll really bring you and the object of your desire together.

About The Greatest Host by Ray Jay Perreault:
A fun short story that is a great way to introduce all age groups to Science Fiction
A wondering alien life form called Mists seek compatible hosts to share their life. The Mists have lived for a long time and shared their lives with many life forms. Throughout the Mists’ life, they have been able to find suitable hosts for short periods and in other hosts, life was hard and risky. Finally, the Mists traveled to a planet and found the perfect hosts to share their life. This is a humorous mix of science fiction and reality. I’m sure any reader will see the humor and appreciate the reality.

Author Bio: Ray was born in New Hampshire, received his Bachelor of Science in Aeronautical Engineering from Arizona State University. Now retired from an influential, multi-decade career in aerospace, Ray is excited to join the Allport Productions team as he carves a new path as a leader in eBook, audiobook and digital book authorship, production and consulting. Bringing a new voice to science fiction writing, Ray realized there was a niche that was calling him as he began to write deeper characters, create more sophisticated stories and realistic situations for Sci-Fi fans. Initially attracted to heroic characters with powerful weapons taking on hundreds of aliens, Ray began his literary career with a desire to extrapolate Sci-Fi stories with a touch of everyday reality that most of us experience in work and our every-day lives. His literary work is thoughtfully enriched by his decade-long experience in the US Air Force where he flew C-130s on missions to 27 countries, and T-38s while training the best pilots in the world, as well as the first female US Air Force pilots. During his 28 years at Northrop Grumman, Ray worked on some of the most top-secret military aircraft projects in the world including the F-23, F-35, B-2, Global Hawk and many more that can’t be named. He is grateful to his wife, Charlene and his two daughters, Christine and Robynn for their support on this new journey."

Roland Quandt Samsung is reportedly planning to release a two-in-one charger for its smartphones and the upcoming Galaxy Watch. Packaging for the Wireless Charger Duo has leaked ahead of Samsungâ€™s Unpacked press conference, which will be held at Barclays Center on August 9th.
The Wireless Charger Duo box reveals that itâ€™s capable of charging either two Qi-compatible phones simultaneously or one phone and the Galaxy Watch. Both placement areas support fast wireless charging. The upcoming Note 9 is rumored to feature a 4,000mAh battery, and Samsung has registered a new wireless charge r that could improve upon the already-fast wireless recharge capabilities of recent Galaxy smartphones. Itâ€™s not yet clear whether the Wireless Charger Duo will be capable of that higher output.
After early rumors hinted at Samsung making a return to Googleâ€™s Wear OS with its next smartwatch, thatâ€™s looking less and less likely. The Galaxy Watch is believed to again run the companyâ€™s own Tizen software.
The Wireless Charger Duo comes as Apple continues working away on its AirPower mat, which was first announced at last Septemberâ€™s iPhone event. While two-way chargers are relatively common, Apple has said that AirPower will simultaneously charge three devices â€"" such as an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. In June, Bloomberg reported that Apple has faced â€œa series of technical hurdlesâ€ during the course of AirPowerâ€™s development, such as making sure the charging mat doesnâ€™t overheat and working with its â€œcomplexâ€ circuitry.
Aga in, Samsungâ€™s Wireless Charger Duo just covers two devices at once. The companyâ€™s Icon X earbuds donâ€™t support wireless charging as of yet. But if youâ€™re planning to pick up both the Note 9 and Galaxy Watch, it might prove a convenient (albeit probably very pricey) accessory.

Dear Friend:
Thank you for agreeing to take care of my dog. I knew you were the right person for the job when you told me about the summer you spent giving insulin shots to your son's aged goldfish, Emil. I also truly appreciate that you did not mind the waivers and paperwork, including the ""Do not even consider not resuscitating"" order and the agreement that you will:
Act as a marrow/stem cell/kidney donor, should Kita require it;
That you would incur all costs if something ever happens to me and Kita's future happiness and vigor depends on her receiving four complete titanium thigh, knee and ankle replacements as well as a bionic tail; and
That you have no qualms about performing CPR and mouth-to-mouth on a dog, even one whose favorite snacks include regurgitated roadkill and sheep entrails (for more information, refer to second half of Section 62(ab) on page 47, paragraph three, of enclosed document titled, ""How to get Kita to eat."")
Obviously, you understand that I love my dog very much. Your own story about performing cardiac massage on that dragonfly that accidentally flew into your windshield told me that you are a person of great compassion.
Anyway, Kita's care routine should be reasonably easy to master for any average citizen, as long as they are a registered nurse with some knowledge of veterinary medicine as well as just a smidge of background in gerontology, physiology, herbal medicine and international law.
I've attached the following ""quick-start"" guide to give you highlights of her care, although you will also want to peruse the supporting materials, which I've thoughtfully collected for you in this four-tier file cabinet.
So here we go:
Food: While Kita was once perfectly happy to chomp away at Alpo like a barbarian, we now order gourmet, made-to-order food from a place called ""The Farmer's Table*."") Her meals — which consist of artisanal lamb gently hand-tossed with organic heirloom vegetables — are gently cooked in sous vide packets, then packed in refrigerated boxes and overnighted to my home for about the cost of an average Thanksgiving dinner.
Come to think of it, it's weird this stuff is called ""The Farmer's Table."" When I grew up on a farm, our dogs ate anything from steak bones and moldy hamburger buns to overripe tomatoes they found in the garden and the occasional bull snake. And you know what? They were incredibly strong.
Now I spend more money on my dog's food than on mine, and my dog requires acupuncture, dental scaling, laser treatments and a drawerful of supplements.
Footnote: Oh, and Kita will not eat the food if it's cold. It needs to be heated to about 115 degrees. But don't microwave it; that will destroy the nutrients. Just heat it gently over low heat. It should be about the temperature of a milk bath for one of the Gabor sisters.
Walking: Kita does not do stairs, should not jump up or down from things and won't walk on bare floors. The tiny Acorn attached to the side of the couch is meant to prevent her from jumping down. It cost me $2,700 off Amazon, and she still jumps off the couch.
Technically, she has three bad legs, but her care team believes she still needs to do some walking to keep her muscles strong and to preserve her sense of ""dogness.""
You will find a tiny, crushed-velvet, red carpet rolled up in the dog-supply door. Simply unfurl this in front of her so she doesn't have to step on laminate. Don't forget to occasionally bow. After feeding her, simply bow and scrape while backing out the door.
Sleep: Our Highness requires a great deal of rest, which is why she has this heated, Tempur-Pedic bed with adjustable bed frame, swan-down pillow-top and cashmere blanket. Mostly, however, she prefers sleeping in my bed so she can watch Animal Planet. Oh, and she doesn't like sharing a bed with anyone because she's self-conscious that her CPAP machine makes her sound like Dog Vader.
So I guess you might as well bring a sleeping bag and sleep on the floor.
But not too far away from her, OK? She usually needs to be carried outside to relieve her bladder at least three times a night.
Yup. It's a dog's life. Readers can reach columnist Tammy Swift at . "

There are a number of posts covering this topic in the forum. So far I can only recall one person saying that they have had their appeal accepted.
I should imagine that your position of being an established author makes your position harder for Amazon since they are trying to prove themselves ""cleaner than clean"" in terms of not allowing fake or sponsored reviews. There guidelines do suggest that there are exceptions allowed to enable reviews but - it would appear - Amazon would prefer to block any reviewer that could imply impropriety.
I do not know if this ban reaches over into Goodreads. Hopefully you could still give reviews there if you wish?
It is a great shame. Many customers enjoy leaving comments both good and bad about products and often those comments were helpful to other customers. I, personally, feel that as the saying goes ""the baby is being thrown out with the bathwater"" where so many innocent customers are being blocked and reviews appear to be few and far between, anodyne and all too frequently still appear to be cut and pastes :(
I wish you good luck with your appeal. CW."

 I am myself an author, with many published books at Amazon: that's probably the reason right there. There were far too many author groups reviewing each others self-published books (glowing reviews of course). Also, it seems that if two authors have the same publisher, are Facebook friends, or have used LinkedIn to connect, they, in Amazon's terms, have a ""personal relationship""."

Share On Facebook in Moments
Life is full of many special moments and a lot of these occur when bringing new life into the world. Having children and starting a family is something many of us dream of and build up how it will go in our heads. Each moment comes with an expectation, such as when it comes to bringing a newborn baby home from the hospital. But when the time finally comes, moms find themselves having thoughts they never anticipated.
Throughout pregnancy, a woman often daydreams about what it will be like to walk out those doors with their little one and begin the journey of motherhood. However, what is often imagined when pregnant isn't always what happens especially when it comes to emotions and thoughts. This can be quite contrasting to the pregnant daydream.
From desperately needing a shower to the thought of fast food overcoming the mind, so many things go through a new mom's head when she is on the journey home with their new baby. Want an insight into these thoughts? Well, thankfully these 20 moms shared with us their some genuine thoughts they had on the day they left the hospital with their baby and some of them are sure to make you laugh. Continue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view 20 I Must Shower Via: Ashley's Green Life
Childbirth is not exactly a cleansing process, it is the opposite. Drop your dignity off at the door and pick it up on your way out is what they say. It is a very messy process with bodily fluids you didn't even know you had and although the hospital shower is fine, there is nothing like going home and cleaning yourself in your own environment.
"" All I could think about was having a shower, in my own shower with my own products. When leaving the hospital, I didn't even stop to get a picture before we got in the car. I just wanted to shower. now! "" This was the response I got from several mothers. 19 Where Can I Get Real Food Advertising [x]
Everyone knows that hospital food is, well, less than satisfactory let’s say that and if you are in there for a long period of time like many pregnant women are, you get fed up of the food quite quickly. So, when you finally get the news from the doctor or nurse that you and your little one can leave the premises and return home, food is automatically on your mind.
"" I didn't care what I ate or where it was from, anything was better than the food from the hospital. Honestly, it was disgusting, "" shared with me a mother with strong feelings about the food that had been served to her during her stay at the hospital. 18 What Have I Forgotten? The Giddy Life
Before you have a baby, you think you own a lot of stuff but you really have no idea what that means. For such a small person, the number of things that they must have to fulfill their needs is unreal so of course, when leaving the hospital you want to make sure you have everything because leaving something behind would be a disaster!
"" I sent my poor Husband back to that hospital twice to check if we forgot anything. Seriously I had about 10 blankets but if I lost one I felt like my child would suffer? Obviously, that is not true, "" a woman reminisced about her time as a new mom leaving the hospital. 17 I Have More Questions Via: VideoBlocks
One of the perks of giving birth in a hospital is that while you are there you have constant access to doctors, nurses, and midwives who will try to answer any questions you may have. So, when it comes time for the both of you to go home you can feel that you are not ready and have more questions that need to be answered.
One mom revealed to me, "" I felt like I knew nothing. On the way, out of the hospital I was dragging the nurse with me asking questions up to the point that I got in the car. Later, I still had more questions but I figured it out as all moms do. "" 16 I Need More Pain Relief
The pain of labor and delivery is unreal and unfortunately, the pain doesn’t stop after birth. The way in which the baby is delivered will determine how much and what pain you are in. When in the hospital you’re given pain relief round the clock and although they give you tablets to take home they are not always as effective.
A mom I spoke to felt she couldn't leave the hospital with her baby without more pain relief, "" I was still in so much pain after my c-section and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to function on just the tablets alone. But in the end, they did the job ."" 15 Why Won't My Band Come Off? Advertising [x]
When you are admitted to hospital they put a band around your wrist with details on it such as name, date of birth etc. The same thing happens to your baby when they are born, they get a band. These bands aren't something you really notice when you are in the hospital but on the way home, they can really annoy you.
"" I, of course, wanted to keep our bands as keepsakes but the problem was I couldn't get them off. You would think they would make them simple to just take off. In the end, we had to cut both mine and my daughters off our wrists, "" a new mom told me. 14 How Does This Car Seat Work Again?
No matter how many you practice putting the car seat in the car or practice by putting a teddy in the car seat (I did make my husband do this), when it comes to taking the new baby home from the hospital not everything goes to plan and you are likely to forget everything you practiced.
Many mothers I spoke to share this common thought: "" I could not remember how to work the car seat. I had practiced so many times and when it came to putting the baby in the car seat and then fitting the car seat in the car my mind went blank! Luckily my Dad saved the day. "" Featured Today There's A Scientific Reason For Why Kids Want To Sit With Mom, Not Dad 13 Slow Down Driver
As a mother, you want to protect your baby from everything! When in the hospital you feel safe, knowing that there is help at your fingertips and there is no immediate threat to you or your baby...and then you get in a car. Of course, being in a car is completely safe but that doesn’t make the first car journey with your baby any less nerve-wracking, which is why you want the driver to drive EXTRA slow.
"" I kept telling my boyfriend to slow down on the drive home. At one point, he said if he went any slower he would just stop, that still makes me laugh to this day, "" laughed a fellow mother. 12 I Escaped
As appreciative we are to all the doctors, nurses, surgeons, and midwives that help us through labor, who aid us in bringing our children into the world safely, sometimes you can feel a bit trapped in the maternity hospital especially if you have been admitted for a long period even during pregnancy.
One mother I spoke to was admitted at 28 weeks pregnant and didn't leave until baby was born at 35 weeks: "" I am thankful to all the hospital staff but oh my goodness when it was finally time to go home with my baby I had this sense of escaping and freedom. I was ecstatic. "" 11 Too Many Germs Via: Pinterest Advertising [x]
Newborn babies are so fragile and are not used to the nasty bugs that are out in the big world thanks to your body protecting them for 9 months. In the hospital, everything is obviously very clean so germs aren't something you are really thinking about until it is time to go home, this can trigger a lot of stress for new moms.
"" I had a massive sign on my car seat telling people not to touch my baby. Sounds crazy but I don't know where people's hands had been and I did not want my baby boy getting ill just as he enters the world, "" admitted a new mom. 10 Leave Me Alone
Of course, friends and family are eager to meet your little bundle of joy and shower them with cards and gifts. But between these beaming visitors and the constant checks by doctors and nurses, by the time you leave the hospital you are often craving some alone time with your baby.
"" I appreciated everyone who wanted to help me out but when we were leaving the hospital I was wishing I could just drive myself home because I was ready to be alone. I was too emotional and tired to entertain company and just wanted to try and get my head around this massive life change ,"" revealed another new mom to me. 9 Don't Forget To Take A Picture
Pictures hold so many memories. Time passes to quickly so to have photographs of the best times in your life that you can look back on is very special. This is why so many moms are determined to get the perfect snap of all their babies first moments, including exiting the hospital and going home.
Several mothers shared this thought as they prepared to take their little one home from the hospital: "" I probably snapped about 100 photos before we even left the hospital room! On the way to the car all I could think about was, did I document this enough? Should I take another quick picture? Turns out I got more than enough shots. "" 8 Where Is The Baby's 'Going Home' Outfit?!
Linking to the previous entry on the list, many new moms are very particular about what their new baby will be wearing on the journey home from the hospital. Whether it be a matching Mummy and me outfit, a personalized garment or just a comfy all-in-one, the going home outfit is usually picked out way ahead of time.
"" My Husband started to put on the wrong outfit and in my hormonal state I started to cry... he soon fixed the problem and our baby was wearing what I had picked out, "" admitted one new mother. 7 I'm Staying In My Pajamas Via: Notonthehighstreet.com Advertising [x]
You might be the most glam woman ever, not leaving the house until you have your hair and makeup is done and your outfit perfect, but this attitude will likely change after you give birth.
Many mothers told me the same thing with regards to outfits and makeup: "" During my pregnancy, I planned the cutest outfit to go home from the hospital in and even practiced my makeup. When it came to the day, however, I was too exhausted and was perfectly happy staying in my pajamas. There was not one part of me that wanted to get dressed when all I was doing was heading straight home. "" 6 Must Read All The Leaflets
On leaving the hospital a nurse is usually instructed to give you out several helpful leaflets. These leaflets include topics such as postpartum depression, breastfeeding, contraception, and more. These can be very useful and if you are a person that likes to be informed about everything you will be diving into those leaflets as soon as you get them, which is what many mothers do.
A fellow mother told me: "" We were just leaving the hospital when the nurse came over with the leaflets. Apart from making sure my baby was in the car seat safely, I didn’t focus on anything else the whole way home. I needed to know everything in those leaflets! "" 5 I'm Starving Via: The Wrap
Cravings during pregnancy are very common but so are cravings after pregnancy! It may be the hospital food making you dream of your favorite comfort foods or the fact that you may not have eaten that much due to the going through labor and delivery, whatever the reason when a new mom is on the way home with her baby she often gets some major food cravings!
One mother I spoke to went through this, "" All I wanted was a pizza. Nothing else would do it, I needed a pizza! I even cried over it that is how much I felt I needed one. I put it down to the hormones and sleep deprivation ."" 4 Can We Register The Birth Now? Via: Amazon
Depending on where you live, how much time you have to register the birth of your baby changes. In some countries, you have a few days and in others, you have multiple weeks, but nowhere makes you register the birth of your child right away. However, that doesn't mean as a mother you won't want to do it straight away.
"" I felt like as soon as we left the hospital our little girl needed to be registered. However, it was the evening and not plausible so I managed to wait until the next day. I just wanted her birth to be official! "" stated a mother about her thoughts when she left the hospital. 3 Must Go To The Supermarket Advertising [x]
Here's another one relating to food, particularly supermarket food. Being in the hospital for days or even weeks can mean that a lack of food in your home. Especially if you live alone usually or that your significant other is not usually the one to do the groceries. So, no wonder many new moms feel that on their way home from the hospital they need to stop to grab a few essentials.
"" My partner told me as he was picking us up that there was no food in the house. I was not pleased at all so I made him stop on the way home to get what we needed. Next time I will make sure to make him a shopping list, "" stated a mom during my survey. 2 Who Am I? Via Faithwire
Speaking from personal experience now, after giving birth I felt like a whole different person. This was not a bad thing, becoming a mother and holding my beautiful daughter for the first time was magical but it does throw you off a bit. On the way home I remember thinking wow, my whole life has changed, I am a different person now! Who am I?
Lots of new mothers feel this way after giving birth as it is a life-changing event so at least we all know we are not alone and you do find your sense of self again, you've just got to get through that first emotional hurdle. 1 OMG I'm A Mom! Via: Huffington Post
""OMG I AM A MOM!"" -- Everyone has this moment. There are no words that can prepare a woman for the moment she becomes a mother, you change as a person for the better and although that can be scary it is also empowering. Life becomes about the little angel you brought into the world and no longer about you and you can be overwhelmed with emotion.
Being a mother is a blessing and no matter what type of woman you are I can bet on the way home from the hospital with your newborn, at some point you will be staring at them and thinking how lucky you are to be there mom.

Not always easy to do, but I came to this vacuum and decided to order it. So, after a few days of forgetting to actually buy it and the two days prime shipping, I just got it today.
Assembly of the Hoover was really simple and easy; took me all of 5 minutes to get it out of the box and have it running. Just a little context: we have 1 dog, 2 cats, and 8 kids. The dog is a German Shepherd/Husky mix and the cats are...well, they are cats. Who cares about the breed; the point is is that they have long hair. The kids are exactly that, concentrated hurricanes of unabashed destruction and chaos. Given it had been somewhere around a week since our vacuum stopped working, our carpets very much needed to be cleaned. The vacuum cleaner is as advertised: lightweight, but solid. It doesn't feel flimsy or cheap.
The moment I turned the vacuum on is when I was truly impressed. I hit the power button and I could feel the vacuum latch onto my carpet. That's when I had a Tim Allen moment and had a real appreciation for the power coming from this machine. Once I was finished with our living room carpet, I was rather shocked at what I had found. There was so much dirt and hair that it picked up. Even for it having been so long. Our previous vacuum had never picked up that much stuff in one go, which leads me to believe it was never actually getting deep into the carpet.
All in all, I am very happy with my purchase. I have not owned it long enough to have any cons to this vacuum cleaner, but if I come across any issues, I will update my review and alter my star rating if needed. I can say that I am actually pretty excited to clean my house and that's something I never thought I would ever be saying."

What she doesn’t reveal is that the person who breathed life into Alexa, and led the technology side of the project almost from its inception five years ago, is Rohit Prasad, an engineer from Ranchi, Jharkhand. Read also: Good things come in small packages Prasad, together with his colleague Toni Reid who focuses on the consumer experience side, was No. 15 on Recode’s list of 100 people in tech, business and media who mattered in 2017. Jeff Bezos, Susan Fowler, Mark Zuckerberg , Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai, Elon Musk and Satya Nadella were among the 14 people ahead of him. Recode said Prasad and Reid had made Alexa a household name. Star Trek inspired Indian techie to create Alexa India-born Rohit Prasad was ranked No. 9 (and Reid No. 10) in Fast Company’s 100 most creative people in business in 2017. Fast Company said Prasad and Reid had turned Alexa into a “category-defining consumer experience.” Amazon, Bennett University set up Alexa Voice Tech Lab As part of its LeadingIndia.AI initiative, Bennett University is creating a hub and spoke model with a vision to partner with 1,000 academic institutions in India to do research and skill development in the field of AI. Prasad still has family in Ranchi and visits the city once every year-and-a-half. Last week was one of those visits. On Thursday, he spent nearly an hour talking to TOI on phone from the Jharkhand capital. “My dad used to work for Mecon, my grandad for HEC (Heavy Engineering Corp), so I have had three generations here,” he says. He’s the kind who makes you feel comfortable. “I still follow The Times of India. It’s my No. 1 news source for understanding what’s going on in India,” was the second line of the conversation. Prasad studied at DAV High School. For engineering, he had multiple offers, including from IIT-Roorkee. He chose Birla Institute of Technology (BIT), Mesra, in Ranchi. “I decided to stay closer home,” he says. He completed his electronics & communication engineering in 1997, and then went to the Illinois Institute of Technology, US, for an MS in electrical engineering, where he did novel research in low bit-rate speech coding for wireless applications. That’s probably where his interest in speech recognition began. Read also: How to set up Alexa on Amazon Echo device For the next 14 years, he was at BBN Technologies , an R&D arm of defence company Raytheon. BBN was one of the founding sites of ARPANET, a predecessor of the internet. It was also one of the leading R&D sites for speech recognition, natural language understanding and machine learning in general, and Prasad was deputy manager for that business unit, leading a multidisciplinary team of researchers, developers, and program managers on large-scale government-and commercially-sponsored projects. In 2013, he moved to Amazon to use the same skills to try and revolutionise how customers interact with Amazon’s products and services. Two years ago, he was redesignated head scientist of Alexa artificial intelligence . “The journey has been exciting. If you look at five years back, talking to a device from a distance, in the midst of a lot of noise, was just science fiction . We grew up in the Star Trek era, that was the inspiration for us,” he says. Captain Kirk and the crew giving voice commands, like “Give me warp speed,” instead of pressing buttons or navigating a menu. Touch is inefficient, says Prasad. In home automation, it means if you have to turn on the garage light, you have to find your phone, find the app, click on it, find the right light, and then get the outcome. “That’s too many steps. Instead, you can just tell Alexa, turn on the garage light.” Prasad says the project involved four big challenges. One, the system must recognise speech. Two, once it recognises speech, it must make sense of the words, or what is called natural language understanding. Three, it must have enough resources to implement the user’s command. And four, the capabilities have to get better each day, understand the context of the user to give the best outcome. Prasad says the inflection point for Alexa came in 2015 when Amazon allowed third-party developers to build skills for Alexa and integrate the voice service into their apps or devices. Suddenly, Alexa could perform innumerable tasks and be present anywhere. Amazon’s marketshare for smart home speakers – where Google Home is potentially formidable – is estimated by some at 76%. What do most use Alexa for? Music is the most popular – asking Alexa to play such-and-such song. In households that have smart devices, Alexa is used a lot to switch on lights, to switch shows on TV. “My personal favourite, since I have family in India and I’m in the States, is to communicate through the Alexa app – video call, drop in to my mother’s kitchen, or when I’m travelling, drop into my kids at home,” says Prasad. This last is a feature that works like an intercom among those who have Alexa devices. Alexa’s India launch was its fourth, after the US, UK and Germany. And Prasad admits India has been the most daunting. Vast diversity of accents, languages, mixed languages. “People are asking Alexa, `weather kya hai’ (what’s the weather). There’s plenty of this mixed language coming in. People pronounce names like Amitabh Bachchan very differently.” Prasad says Alexa tackles much of this quite effectively today, but says it will get better as it learns from more interactions. He is particularly happy with the way Alexa speaks. “It’s very Indian, the accent is very neutral, it has to sound pleasant to a Tamil speaker, to a Bengali speaker, a Kannada speaker. It should not sound funny, and we have accomplished that,” he says. His current focus is to improve Alexa’s core intelligence, enable her to deal with ambiguous commands and to accomplish complex tasks – like planning a vacation. “Then it will be a lot more human like,” he says. And yes, in India, he has to deal with the frequent use of the Hindi word `Achcha’. It often sounds so like `Alexa’, that it tends to wake up Alexa when someone uses the word. “We have taken steps to make Alexa sensitive to the difference,” says Prasad.

The event begins when Barry Allen awakes in an alternate timeline. His world, the world that exists in the post-Crisis continuity, no longer surrounds him. Folks that should be friends are enemies. Some heroes aren’t so heroic. War engulfs the world. And Barry Allen himself is not even Speedster, let alone The Flash. “Flashpoint” presents a harrowing depiction of the DC Universe. Once the timeline is restored to a more favorable state, things are still not as they once were. Many characters and their origin stories receive extensive alterations. New heroes and villains also debut. In short, the reversal of “Flashpoint” gives birth to the New 52, a rebooted vision of DC lore.
For nearly five years, the New 52 acted as the primary continuity. New number ones were launched, unexpected adventures were embarked upon. A lot of good came out of the New 52 and, by proxy, “Flashpoint”. Readers who were new to comics could jump in and feel relatively good about picking up a series. Simplicity had seemingly returned. However, not every aspect of the reboot brought sunshine and rainbows. The clean slate provided courtesy of “Flashpoint” was not wholly agreeable on all fronts. In the following list, we will examine 10 reasons why the event deserves praise as perhaps the best thing to happen to DC. Furthermore, 10 reasons why “Flashpoint” does not count as one of DC’s better choices will receive examination as well.
20 . GOOD: REBOOTED UNIVERSE
Hundreds, perhaps thousands of characters exist in DC’s post- Crisis continuity, which lasted from 1986 to 2011. Over 25 years of comic book history is difficult to keep up with, even for just one publishing house. This especially rings true when characters die, return from the dead, or are completely separated from their normal forms. The DC Universe underwent plenty of other changes during this time period. For instance, two new Robins entered the fold.
The beauty of the effects of “Flashpoint” on the DCU rests in its kickstarting a new continuity, free from many trappings of the previous one. Thus, character and readers received a fresh start. For the first time in a quarter of a century, DC comics were more accessible than ever.
19 . BAD: INTERRUPTED STORYLINES
Revamping a universe means tossing aside whatever previously existed. Therefore, some storylines didn’t get their due. Dick Grayson’s run as the Dark Knight offers one example. His time as the Bat is thrilling, yet disappointingly short-lived. Upon his return in the New 52, he once again dons Nightwing garb, albeit with a different color scheme.
Another notable example is Grant Morrison’s acclaimed Batman run, which had Batman Incorporated well underway. The meaning of Batman was changing, evolving to encapsulate more than one man and his vision. These plans came with a suit redesign that would see the classic black and yellow emblem return. Unfortunately, the New 52 couldn’t make room for such plans as a new team ushered in a new era of Batman-centric storytelling.
18 . GOOD: THE COURT OF OWLS
“Flashpoint” bears responsibility for closing the door on one chapter in the DC Universe and opening another. Thus, changes were inevitably brought forth. Interestingly, the world expands. Gotham in particular develops a deeper history than that which governed it previously. This is thanks to the work of Scott Snyder, who created one of the most well-developed additions to Batman lore in years with the Court of Owls.
The Court’s influence on Gotham spans centuries. They work in the shadows, but evidence of their hold over the city proves visible in the light. Batman begins questioning how well he knows the city he protects, how well he knows his family. The Court of Owls engulfs Gotham in a level of intrigue that had seldom been explored before.
17 . BAD: WONDER WOMAN’S ALTERED ORIGIN
Wonder Woman’s origin always maintained that she was born from clay. Symbolically, this origin reinforces her being perfect. Of course, it’s also central to her role as a feminist icon. She’s a woman born and raised on an island filled with women, with no male figure ever having an influence on her life. In the New 52, Wonder Woman’s origin change drastically. Instead of being molded out of clay, Zeus fathers her.
This change and others, such as Diana’s being trained by Ares as opposed to other Amazons, somewhat negates her role in popular culture. It, arguably, undermines her status as a feminist icon, but also compromises Wonder Woman’s uniqueness. At the core, the New 52 origin presents her as just another demi-God.
16 . GOOD: FLASHPOINT BATMAN
For a character that exists in an alternate timeline and has a limited presence, Flashpoint Batman accumulated quite the following. This following extends to mainstream audiences, who want to see the character depicted on the big screen. Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox , the event’s animated adaptation, rests at the heart of such interests.
What’s most appealing about this version of the Bat is its presentation of the Wayne murders — Bruce dies instead of his parents. Therefore, his father, Thomas, develops a hunger for vengeance that he fuels by stopping criminals. Flashpoint Batman remains a treasured character because his beliefs are antithetical to those of Batman. Thus, the morally ambiguous behavior that Batman could partake in receives exploration without tarnishing the character himself.
15 . BAD: BARBARA’S DISABILITY ERASED
As an influential character, Barbara’s suffering at the hands of The Killing Joke’s Joker remains a point of contention. However, DC wasted no time in twisting the narrative in a positive fashion. Less than a year after the graphic novel’s publication, Babs debuts in Suicide Squad #23 as Oracle. Her paralysis keeps her from donning a cape and cowl, yet fails to prevent her from fighting crime.
With intelligence, technical prowess, and an understanding of Gotham’s underworld, Oracle maintains her role as a valued Bat-family member. She accomplishes this from a wheelchair, an inspiring feat that’s influenced decades of people in need of a hero. Here lies the trouble with Barbara reclaiming Batgirl’s mantle — erasing her disability discards a hero that represents more than just another crimefighter.
14 . GOOD: MIDNIGHTER
In the minds of many, Midnighter is a Batman analogue with a penchant for permanently ending criminals. His status as an openly gay man who’s as committed to his work as he is his boyfriend, Apollo, makes him unique in the world of comics. Of course, Midnighter’s no where close to being the first or sole gay superhero. However, there do exist instances where his books are the only ongoing series starring a gay lead character.
Midnighter’s series, along with the many appearances he makes across other books, are considered amongst the New 52’s finest stories. His heartwarming relationship with Apollo and the partnership he shares with Dick Grayson ensures this addition to the revamped continuity won’t soon be forgotten.
13 . BAD: CHARACTER ROLES DIMINISHED
The changes brought about by “Flashpoint” are many in number. For some characters, the New 52 doesn’t merely alter them, it abandons their roles entirely. Such heroes/villains only appear for a fleeting period of time, their presence so inconsequential that they are hardly remembered.
One such character is Lady Blaze, a Superman villain from the ’90s who once held great promise. During the New 52, she’s little more than a side character who appears when a story conveniently requires her involvement. Unfortunately, the same can be said of Obsidian. The few appearances he makes are exclusive to the Earth 2 series, but even there his time is limited.
12 . GOOD: BARRY ALLEN RECLAIMS FLASH TITLE
For about a quarter of a century, Barry Allen’s Flash was absent from the DC Universe. Final Crisis marks Barry’s initial return to continuity. However, The Flash: Rebirth depicts his official comeback story. At the time, this brought about a bevy of concerns. These include Barry’s sacrifice during Crisis on Infinite Earths becoming meaningless and Wally West no longer being the primary Flash.
But Barry Allen’s return ushers in a new age of Flash-centric stories. His origin receives a few alterations. The same can be said of his relationships to certain characters. Additionally, without Barry’s return, as far as the narrative is concerned, there would not be a New 52.
11 . BAD: JASON TODD’S ORIGINS CHANGED
Prior to the New 52, Jason Todd undergoes two origin stories. One, set in the pre- Crisis continuity, resembles Dick Grayson’s origins. Jason’s a young boy whose parents are performers in the circus. After his parents die at the hands of criminals, Jason is adopted by Bruce Wayne. Jason’s post- Crisis origin positions him as an orphan who steals to get by. An attempt to lift tires from the Batmobile garners him the attention of Batman.
New 52 replaces the above backstories with something far more sinister. His family’s misfortunes, the imprisonment and eventual death of his father and his mother’s substance abuse, are all orchestrated by the Joker. It’s an interesting story, sure, but removes agency from an already tragic character.
10 . GOOD: AGENT GRAYSON
Dick Grayson arrives in the New 52 a changed man. After spending time wearing Batman’s cape and cowl for a spell, he begins to see things differently. All crime-ridden cities are brutal, but Gotham is a different brand of brutal. He realizes this and becomes a bit more hardened, while still maintaining his good-naturedness. It isn’t long before he’s placed in a compromising position. Nightwing’s identity as Dick Grayson is outed — however, he refuses to give up crimefighting.
Agent Grayson of Spyral is born. Batman assigns Dick the task of infiltrating the clandestine UN agency, acting as a double agent. His adventures as a Spyral agent culminate in well-developed stories and an awesome team up with Midnighter.
9 . BAD: LOBO
The most notable of Lobo’s origins rests in his post- Crisis existence. This version depicts him as the foulest member of a peaceful race on the planet Czarnia. Apparently, he’s born mad and acts on his depraved predispositions quite often. Eventually, Lobo wipes out his entire race and flees the planet. His adventures throughout space set him on a path to becoming an intergalactic bounty hunter.
In the New 52, very little of his origins receive attention. But Lobo’s new design and status as a mere villainous alien acts as a prime example for why the New 52 isn’t favored. A later storyline reveals this version of Lobo is an impostor. The real Lobo must take him down, but for many fans the damage was done.
8 . GOOD: THE OMEGA MEN
“Convergence” essentially marks an end to the New 52. However, many of those stories and characters were translated into DC You. While The Omega Men series is a part of the DC You relaunch, the various hiccups in New 52 sets the acclaimed series in motion. The new initiative itself remains somewhat divisive, yet The Omega Men is one of the few bright lights.
The aftermath of New 52’s “Convergence” allows for the reinvention of The Omega Men. Writer Tom King tells an incredibly impactful story about war that mixes impressively with the science fiction and superhero elements of the characters. If there’s ever a reason to return to this time in DC history, The Omega Men are it.
7 . BAD: THE AMAZON’S CONNECTION TO MAN
Prior to the New 52, Amazons escape the world of man. They find refuge on Themyscira, an island where only they are permitted to reside. Not until Steve Trevor crashes onto their shores do the worlds of man and Amazon collide. Despite his goodness, many of the Amazons remain skeptical. Of course, Diana, for a time, is the only inhabitant of Themyscira to make the trek to the world as we know it.
The New 52 heavily revises this history. As a result, the Amazons abuse their power. Whenever men draw approach the island’s shores, they are taken advantage of and wiped out. Thus, the peace that typically shapes the inspiring ideals of Paradise Island are exchanged for violence and vengeance.
6 . GOOD: BARBARA GORDON IS BATGIRL AGAIN
The erasure of Barbara Gordon’s disability certainly isn’t one of the New 52’s best qualities. Therefore, it’s weird that her reclaiming the title of Batgirl remains one of the relaunch’s high points. It primarily comes down to Gail Simone’s acclaimed run on the character’s series, and the tonal shift after her departure. Seeing Babs retake the Batgirl mantle is thrilling because she faces intriguing challenges both on the streets of Gotham and in her private life.
Mirror, the first foe Babs faces after her return, debuts in the New 52. A new version of the Ventriloquist receives introduction, as well. Not everything about New 52 Batgirl is a home run. But when the stories are good, they are incredibly immersive.
5 . BAD: ERASED ESTABLISHED HISTORY
Discarding established history comes with the territory when continuity receives a reboot. Character origins are bound to change and certain events are to be forgotten. The proverbial slate is wiped completely clean in favor of starting fresh. For comics, this allows companies to give new readers an opportunity to join the fun as the fresh start accounts for accessibility. Reboots also offer creators a chance to try new avenues, take a character to places they’ve never been, explore long-imagined horizons.
Admittedly, all of the above sounds wonderful. However, these changes are made to the detriment of established lore. Character development is tossed aside and the once harrowing circumstances that haunted a favorite hero or villain no longer bears any significance.
4 . GOOD: BATWOMAN
This entry should come with an asterisk, denoting that New 52 Batwoman is good… for the most part. The 2011 relaunch is kind to this member of the Bat-family. Fantastic storytelling, beautiful character development, and tons of fan support ensure that Batwoman is at her best after “Flashpoint” reboots the universe.
All seems well when wedding bells begin to ring. Kate Kane proposes to her girlfriend, Maggie Sawyer. However, the couple never gets to tie the knot. Editorial keeps the two from marrying, which prompts the creative team behind New 52 Batwoman to depart. It’s unfortunate that something so wonderful is relegated to heartbreak for both the characters and fans.
3 . BAD: DISJOINTED CONTINUITY
Ongoing stories don’t always open and close with a nice bow. Things get messy. Dates are confused, timelines fail to sync, etc. It should be no surprise, then, that rebooting an entire universe exacerbates these issues. Barring Batman and Green Lantern, The New 52 begins similarly for every hero. They’ve been active for five years by the time readers catch up with their adventures.
On the surface, this works. However, that most characters become active at the same time is absurd. The problem proliferates when considering Batman’s role. He’s supposed to have experienced 25 years of history in half a decade? This is especially worrisome as there are references to Dick’s time as Batman. It’s not the New 52’s most significant problem, but it warrants acknowledgement.
2 . GOOD: DC YOU
DC You acted as a move away from the New 52. However, those character origins still count as part of the DC You initiative. With this new launch, the publisher mostly abandons the idea of continuity. Self-contained stories are told, instead of focus being geared towards telling small pieces of one whole narrative.
Thus, we get the likes of DC You Superman who’s depowered and has his identity publicly outed. This is also the initiative that gives rise to James Gordon wearing a Batman mech-suit. Other notable positives include the launch of Cyborg’s first solo series, the reinvention of The Omega Men , and the awesomeness that comes from Midnighter’s adventures.
1 . BAD: EDITORIAL TROUBLES
Because the slate’s clean for continuity’s sake, several inconsistencies arise during the New 52. This is due to writers and artists not receiving a full rundown from higher-ups (for example, George Pérez on Superman ). However, other editorial issues plague the relaunch, too. Certain design choices never quite strike a chord and the reinvention of some characters is regarded as troublesome. Creative differences between writers/artists, and editors led to a few teams departing projects.
The most well known of harrowing editorial tales lies with J. H. Williams III’s and Haden Blackman’s beloved work on Batwoman . DC’s refusal to let Kate Kane marry her girlfriend remains controversial, which worsened when it was later explained that vigilantes live so dangerously that marriage is never an option.

Four Windows Press has announced that the latest book by Ethel Mortenson Davis is now available on Amazon. Ethel is one of my favorite poets, and I hope you’ll take a look. Here is the link: https://www.amazon.com/Under-Tail-Milky-Way-Galaxy/dp/1719303886/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1532120613&sr=8-1&keywords=under+the+tail+of+the+milky+way+ethel+davis fourwindowspress
Four Windows Press has just published Ethel Mortenson Davis’s new book, Under the Tail of the Milky Way Galaxy .
This is Ethel’s fifth book of poetry and has all of the poems she has written since moving to Wisconsin from New Mexico.
John Looker, one of the world’s finest poets, The Human Hive , wrote from Great Britain that “Here is a harvest of finely-judged lyrical poems that express a joy in the natural world. Carefully observed and beautifully expressed, they are not just nature poems however. Ethel Mortenson Davis has a deep reverence for nature, coupled with a sadness at humankind’s frequent indifference.”
Standing Feather, whose book, The Glowing Pink , has recently been published by Four Windows Press, said in his review that “There is something profoundly spiritual and tragically elusive in our understanding of the vast wilderness.

Time to ditch the tangible mindset A woman poses for a photograph with the Harry Potter trolley at King’s Cross station in London. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters T ake a walk through King’s Cross station most days of the week, and you will see a crowd of people gathered among the usual rush of commuters and weary travellers awaiting the umpteenth delayed London-to-Leeds service.
This isn’t the complaints queue for cancellations. These people have travelled from further afield than Bradford – from South Korea, the US , France and Germany – to wait for a train that doesn’t even exist.
Having started as a humble homage to the Harry Potter books, the gap between platforms nine and 10has developed into one of the biggest tourist attractions in the capital. Alongside the plaque marking the fictional platform 9 ¾ and the luggage trolley stuck halfway into the wall, there is a gift shop and professional photographer. There are always queues. This is a lucrative combination of capitalism and the human imagination.
As a metaphor for the future of the British economy, the boy wizard created by JK Rowling and the queues for the Hogwarts Express are apt.
Advanced economies around the world are increasingly moving away from producing tangible goods to become more adept at creating intangible value – through branding, intellectual property and computer software – of the kind exemplified by the Harry Potter franchise. Once upon a time wealth was defined by physical assets. Nowadays companies like Amazon and Google rank as among the most valuable in the world despite making very little of physical worth.
Herein lies the problem for Britain. Besides figuring out how to tax the seemingly magical profits of the internet firms, the rise of the intangible economy poses the UK with two tough questions.
First, there is the problem with measurement. At the end of next month, Jonathan Haskel, an expert in intangible economics at Imperial College, will become a member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee to help Threadneedle Street better understand the challenges ahead.
Answering questions from the Treasury select committee last month before his appointment, he used the example of Harry Potter as a “bundle of intangible assets”, telling MPs: “It is the creative copyright from the book. It is the software that goes into the movie. It is the branding. It is the set design that gives you all these gothic decorations that you see in the film, in the play and that kind of thing. There is a whole bundle of intangible assets. The economy is moving much more in that direction.”
Haskel has written a book on the subject, Capitalism Without Capital, to explain the challenges. Principal among them is measuring the gains for the economy from things that cannot be held firmly by hand.
Google’s chief economist, Hal Varian, takes this further, pointing out that about 80bn photographs were taken all over the world at the turn of the millennium, at a cost of approximately 50 cents (38p) each using a traditional camera. By 2015, smartphones enabled as many as 1.6tn photographs to be taken for free. While GDP – the universal economic measure of expenditure, production and earnings – should rise with economic progress, it fails to capture this shift. The loss in terms of foregone production and sales of cameras actually means GDP goes the other way.
The economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Felix Eggers and Avinash Gannamaneni have tried to measure the value of free digital goods and have come up with staggering results. Overall, they say, our use of search engines, email and other products like social media and digital maps should cost as much as $25,700 (£19,560) a year per typical internet user if it was not free. This is yet more value missing in action from the modern economy.
Some monetary policy hawks argue higher interest rates are required because the economy may be performing better than the figures, missing these elements, appear to suggest. But they would be wrong to believe Britain is perfectly placed to benefit from the intangible economy. There are many things holding back its development. Which brings us to the second point in the debate about intangibles: finance.
Like the Dementors in Rowling’s books, the banking industry acts to sap the vitality of the intangible economy. Most economists agree the big thing needed in Britain is greater levels of investment, particularly as Brexit discourages firms from spending . But there are significant barriers for borrowing to invest in intangible assets from the current financial setup.
In the UK, banks favour lending for property over and above loans to other areas. After the financial crisis, they demanded greater security for lending. Regulators at the Bank of England have pushed them in this direction, too. Safety first, so the story goes, lest the crash reoccurs.
But banks could do more, rather than simply crawling over one another to lend against physical collateral – such as a home, or a factory or piece of machinery for a business. Our economy suffers as a consequence, with inflated house prices and not enough being lent to new businesses.
Getting a loan for an investment in area where the banks cannot demand security in exchange is much more difficult. It ought not to be, in the right circumstances. It’s an issue latched on to by the Labour party with zeal. It argues that the Royal Bank of Scotland should be fully nationalised , and then broken up into a network of community banks in order to spur greater levels of productive lending to small businesses trying to tap into this new economic future. This may be unrealistic, given the changes at RBS and its gradual return to the private sector in recent years, with the latest sale of shares in June making it even harder for Labour to take control if in government.
But Labour does have a point, and find unusual favour in the form of the Bank of England’s chief economist. Although not referring to Labour’s plans, Andy Haldane used a speech last month to point to the network of regional banks in Germany, known as the Sparkassen, as one way the German economy is better suited for developing its intangible economy. Labour’s regional network of banks would be similar in design. [embedded content] Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk
There are also institutions dedicated to the better diffusion of new ideas into the business community.
The Fraunhofer research societies help thousands of companies each year to develop new ideas. The same task is carried out by the Steinbeis Foundation , which helps transfer academic findings into the field of business. Some of this German thinking would help Britain progress. Haldane points to them both as ways to improve UKproductivity, which has been lingering in the doldrums and delaying wage growth since the financial crisis.
The UK has many things in its favour. English laws protecting intellectual property rights are among the most renowned in the world, encouraging innovation. The government’s industrial strategy is also providing greater funding for infrastructure, skills and training, while also spending more public money on research and development. But not enough is being done. Business leaders are desperate for a greater vision.
Government ministers may be cautious about the idea of picking winners, but they ought to remember this is really about picking the winning economic model for the future. Do the Conservatives and the banks want to be on the side of Potter, or impeding progress?

Her mother died when she was a teenager, and her billionaire/mogul father all but abandoned her and her two younger siblings. He kept them monetarily, but in the absence of a true parent for her brother and sister, Isadora stepped into that role. A role that cost her a normal life of a young lady.
Instead of college and parties, she cared for her siblings and made sure their needs were met first, without daring to dream of a life for herself.
""Her wings had been clipped the day her father left and she feared she'd eventually be left all alone in an empty nest, too afraid to fly after her own dreams--whatever they might be.""
When her brother leaves for college and her sister starts becoming more independent, things change for Isadora.
Someone that had been there all along takes on a new role in her life. That someone is her father's work associate/friend, Sawyer. This changes everything for Isadora.
Here's the blurb from Amazon :
S acrifice of the Pawn (Surrender Games 1) Surrender Games follows the emotionally charged and highly erotic contemporary romance saga, The Surrender Trilogy. Isadora Patras has sacrificed years raising her younger siblings, Lucian and Antoinette. As her brother and sister grow more independent, she feels her purpose is lost. Aching to do something selfish and hungry for a taste of the forbidden, she takes a lover—her father’s protégé and trusted family friend, Sawyer Bishop. In a secret affair trust is tested, respect is bartered, and reputations are on the line. Sawyer has always been Isadora’s mentor, but now it’s her move. She’s through being a pawn and ready to demand the respect of a Queen.
What I really loved about this book was the growth of the characters. They went through realistic changes over the passing of time, some for the better, some not. There were no over night changes, and the story's span of over a decade spaced it well.
What I wished were different about this book was that it has a cliffhanger ending... and the prologue is kind of cliff-hanger-y too, as we don't know how it connects. One would have to read the next book to find out what happens.
But I will.
Because I really loved this book. It had my attention from start to finish, and I read it practically straight through.
Thank you to Lydia Michaels! I won this Kindle copy in a contest, and I am so grateful to have been given the chance to read it. This was my first book by this author, and I am off to read my next!
4/5 Stars

Amazon CloudWatch shows two types of RDS metrics: Built-in Metrics Enhanced Monitoring Metrics Built-in Metrics
These metrics are available from any RDS instance. They are collected from the hypervisor of the host running the RDS virtual machine. Some of the metrics may not be available for all database engines, but the important ones are common.
It is recommended the following RDS metrics are monitored from CloudWatch Metric Why you should monitor it CPUUtilization % CPU load in the RDS instance. A consistent high value means one or more processes are waiting for CPU time while one or more processes are blocking it. DiskQueueDepth The number of input and output requests waiting for the disk resource. A consistent high value means disk resource contention – perhaps due to locking, long running update queries etc. DatabaseConnections The number of database connections against the RDS instance. A sudden spike should be investigated immediately. It may not mean a DDOS attack, but a possible issue with the application generating multiple connections per request. FreeableMemory The amount of RAM available in the RDS instance, expressed in bytes. A very low value means the instance is under memory pressure. FreeStorageSpace Amount of disk storage available in bytes. A small value means disk space is running out. ReadIOPS The average number of disk read operations per second. Should be monitored for sudden spikes. Can mean runaway queries. WriteIOPS The average number of disk write operations per second. Should be monitored for sudden spikes. Can mean a very large data modification ReadLatency The average time in milliseconds to perform a read operation from the disk. A higher value may mean a slow disk operation, probably caused by locking. WriteLatency The average time in milliseconds to perform a write operation to disk. A higher value may means disk contention. ReplicaLag How far in time, the read replica of MySQL, MariaDB or PostgreSQL instance is lagging behind from its master A high lag value can means read operations from replica is not serving the current data.
Amazon RDS Aurora engine also exposes some extra counters which are really useful for troubleshooting. At the time of writing, Aurora supports MySQL and PostgreSQL only. We recommend monitoring these counters: Metric Why you should monitor it DDLLatency The average time in milliseconds to complete Data Definition Language (DDL) commands like CREATE, DROP, ALTER etc. A high value means the database is having performance issues running DDL commands. This can be due to exclusive locks on objects. SelectLatency The average time in milliseconds to complete SELECT queries. A high value may mean disk contention, poorly written queries, missing indexes etc. InsertLatency The average time in milliseconds to complete INSERT commands. A high value may mean locking or poorly written INSERT command. DeleteLatency The average time in milliseconds to complete DELETE commands. A high value may mean locking or poorly written DELETE command. UpdateLatency The average time in milliseconds to complete UPDATE commands. A high value may mean locking or poorly written UPDATE command. Deadlocks The average number of deadlocks happening per second in the database. More than 0 should be a concern – it means the application queries are running in such a way that they are blocking each other frequently. BufferCacheHitRatio The percentage of queries that can be served by data already stored in memory It should be a high value, near 100, meaning queries are don’t have to access disk for fetching data. Queries The average number of queries executed per second This should have a steady, average value. Any sudden spike or dip should be investigated.
You can use the AWS documentation for a complete list of built-in RDS metrics. Enhanced Monitoring Metrics
RDS also exposes “enhanced monitoring metrics.” These are collected by agents running on the RDS instances’ operating system. Enhanced monitoring can be enabled when an instance is first created or it can be enabled later. It is recommended enabling it because it offers a better view of the database engine.
Like built-in metrics, enhanced metrics are available from the RDS console. Unlike built-in metrics though, enhanced metrics are not readily accessible from CloudWatch Metrics console. When enhanced monitoring is enabled, CloudWatch creates a log group called RDSOSMetrics in CloudWatch Logs:
Under this log group, there will be a log stream for each RDS instance with enhanced monitoring. Each log stream will contain a series of JSON documents as records. Each JSON document will show a series of metrics collected at regular intervals (by default every minute). Here is a sample excerpt from one such JSON document: {"

During a panel for the show this weekend at San Diego Comic-Con, the show shared a video from the main cast and crew, thanking their passionate fans for helping save the show and giving the series a bright future with Amazon.
In addition to thanking fans, the video features some recently released concept art of the planet Ilus from season 4. The showrunner and cast also tease what's to come in the show's fourth season, which will adapt the novel Cibola Burn . Check out the SDCC video message below:
Executive producer and showrunner Naren Shankar also spoke at the SDCC panel about season 4 and how it begins a new chapter for the show. As fans remember, season 3 ended with portals to 1300 habitable systems opening up inside the Ring. Now with endless possibilities, the show will venture into a new frontier that should excite fans:
We’re in what is really second big movement of the books — it’s a new chapter. They’re no longer constrained by just being able to go in the solar system. New worlds have opened up. How humanity deals with his vast new frontier in a situation where resources have been constrained and how that effects society…that the big next chapter of The Expanse.
Shankar also discussed how the move to Amazon will affect the show both creatively and behind the scenes. Now that the series is on a streaming platform rather than network television, The Expanse does not have to worry about language, content or time restrictions:
It’s going to be more awesome. We no longer have the language restrictions. [We can] curse like a sailor. We don’t have the nudity restrictions… and the 4K and HDR will look amazing on Amazon. We’re no longer constrained by a 43-minute box. We can put some air into it, let things breathe a little bit more. So we’re excited to be on Amazon Prime.
Are you excited for the next season of The Expanse ? Season 4 is expected to debut on Amazon Prime sometime in 2019."

I had the same problem trying to figure out which guns were in which socks. I went over to an office supply store and bought a package of white price tags, with string. Then I marked on the tag enough info to allow me to easily identify the gun ie: S&W 15-2 snub or S&W 1905, r/b, nickel 6"" and for those guns, of which I have several of the same model I will add the DOS year.

New York Yankees Live Stream Free: Start Time, As Trade Target Jacob deGrom On Mound",2018-07-23T00:16:00.000+03:00,news,US,2130,Jonathan Vankin,"Gadgets July 22, 2018 Watch New York Mets Vs. New York Yankees Live Stream Free: Trade Target Jacob deGrom Takes The Mound One of the New York Yankees' top trade targets, New York Mets ace righty Jacob deGrom, takes the mound against his possible future team Sunday night. Al Bello / Getty Images Jonathan Vankin One of the New York Yankees' top trade targets, New York Mets ace righty Jacob deGrom, takes the mound against his possible future team Sunday night.
The New York Yankees and New York Mets play the deciding game of their three-game, interleague Subway Series on Sunday. The Yankees need a victory to keep pace in the American League East with the first-place Boston Red Sox, who opened up a five-game lead with their victory over the Detroit Tigers earlier in the day, as MLB.com reports. But the featured attraction of the day will certainly be 30-year-old Mets righty ace Jacob deGrom, who according to numerous reports, could soon be pitching in pinstripes.
The Yankees-Mets game will live stream from Yankee Stadium in the Bronx on Sunday, and deGrom will have a national showcase for other teams who may be interested in dealing for the Major League ERA leader — the Chicago Cubs tops among them, according to ESPN .
But SB Nation baseball writer Brent Borzelli wrote recently that the Yankees could prove to be the best fit for deGrom, if indeed the faltering Mets decide to unload the righty in hopes of rebuilding their struggling team in a hurry.
“The Yankees are in a unique position to help the Mets in all areas of need, without diminishing their own team,” Borzelli wrote. “Would the Mets execute a deal with their crosstown rivals? They’d be foolish not to, especially if the Yankees make the best offer. Shunning the best package to avoid helping the Yankees would be like cutting off your nose to spite your face.” Jacob deGrom of the Mets faces the Yankees on Sunday night, but he may soon be switching sides, trade rumors say.

To find out how to watch a live stream of the New York Mets vs. New York Yankees Major League Baseball final “Subway Series” clash of 2018 from Yankee Stadium, see the streaming information at the bottom of this article. First pitch is set for 8:05 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time or 5:05 p.m. Pacific Time on Sunday, July 20.
The five-year veteran, who was drafted in the ninth round by the Mets in 2010 out of Calvary Christian Academy in Ormond Beach, Florida, has faced the Yankees once this year. Jacob deGrom ended up on the losing side of a 4-1 decision despite hurling eight strong innings, giving up just four hits and striking out eight, as Baseball Reference records.
His 1.68 ERA leads the Majors, and his strikeout rate of 10.873 per nine innings ranks 10th overall, fourth in the National League, per Baseball Reference stats.
The Houston Astros have been pegged as another possible trading partner for the Mets in a deGrom deal, according to NJ.com . But deGrom says that he would be happy to stay with the Mets, saying, “I’ve enjoyed my time here.”
The Yankees on Sunday night will counter with their own righty, 29-year-old Masahiro Tanaka who brings a 7-2 record and 4.54 ERA with 83 strikeouts in 83 1/3 innings into the series-deciding matchup with the crosstown Mets. The New York Yankees will counter Jacob deGrom with 29-year-old righty Masahiro Tanaka on Sunday. Al Bello / Getty Images
To watch the New York Mets vs. New York Yankees Subway Series finale live stream for free, use one of the multiple live stream feeds provided by MLB.TV , where the online streaming subscription service of Major League Baseball is offering the Mets vs. Yankees matchup as one its “Free Game of the Day” offerings — on a Sunday when every game is being offered for free by MLB.TV.
That means the game may be streamed live via the MLB.TV site by anyone — without a fee — though a quick signup for the free MLB.com site membership is required. The Sunday night New York Mets vs. New York Yankees live stream can also be viewed for free using the MLB At Bat app for mobile devices, as well as on the MLB channel offered on set-top streaming boxes such as the Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, and others.
Another way to watch the New York Mets vs. New York Yankees interleague showdown live stream, use the stream provided by WatchESPN . Accessing the WatchESPN live stream requires login credentials from a cable or satellite TV provider subscription, however.
Fans who do not have login credentials to view WatchESPN online can still watch the New York vs. New York Sunday Night Baseball game stream live for free without a cable subscription. Fans may sign up for a free trial of an “over the top” streaming TV package such as Sling TV or YouTube TV . Both services require credit card information and subscription fees, but each offers a seven-day free trial, and if the subscription is canceled prior to the expiration of that weeklong period, fans can watch the New York Mets vs. New York Yankees MLB matchup live stream for free.

to whatever extent monsters exist, the way US society and capitalism works has made it possible to organize our efforts into immortal, amoral entities that want only to take as much as possible from everyone, regardless of the social effects, curbed only by the threat of legal initiation of violence by the state (the next larger monster).
this is the very definition of a modern monster, and that people prettymuch all participate willingly in feeding and care and propagation and growth of these for-profit corporate beasts is more a reflection of how broken and disconnected people have become from the nature of what's really happening."

First of all, buying 6 books every week is bullshit. Maybe, but I strongly assume she is loaning them to read them over a long time and won't be loaning many books for a long time. So the week for week comparison is bullshit unless she is some hyper speed reader. Making a shit comparison is not murder. It doesn't illustrate he is wrong.
Amazon taking over libraries doesn't mean they will only sell new books. They can sell old books or loan books to people. And then running a library won't suddenly become 100 times more expensive. If the state can run it cheap so can companies. They are not idiots who don't know how to run stuff effectively if there is competition in the area.

So he's basic points are this:
The value of a library is to provide a) a safe place to read and study/research, b) provide books to read, and c) a place for community.
""Third places"" such as Starbucks provide for the value of (a), the rise of electronic books have made hardcover books obsolete so negates the value of (b), there are multiple other places which provide the value of (c).
Amazon Books should start operating in more local communities as it could replace libraries and make the tax that goes into libraries redundant.
So let's do a close reading of the article and think of counter examples to why this doesn't make much sense:
There was a time local libraries offered the local community lots of services in exchange for their tax money. They would bring books, magazines, and journals to the masses through a borrowing system. Residents could borrow any book they wanted, read it, and return it for someone else to read.
They also provided residents with a comfortable place they could enjoy their books. They provided people with a place they could do their research in peace with the help of friendly librarians. Libraries served as a place where residents could hold their community events, but this was a function they shared with school auditoriums. There’s no shortage of places to hold community events.
Libraries slowly began to service the local community more. Libraries introduced video rentals and free internet access. The modern local library still provides these services, but they don’t have the same value they used to. The reasons why are obvious.
This just goes into the first point, so there is no argument here. It is just stating what the values of paying a tax on libraries are. I see no reason to really contest this point, as this is what the basic functions are for a library.
One such reason is the rise of “third places” such as Starbucks. They provide residents with a comfortable place to read, surf the web, meet their friends and associates, and enjoy a great drink. This is why some people have started using their loyalty card at Starbucks more than they use their library card.
This is where the points start to get contestable. While I can see value in going to starbucks over a library, especially when it comes to the fact that starbucks now lets you loiter , I would not be using it to study like I would in a library. For one, starbucks functions more as a hangout to talk and pass around ideas, whereas a library goes more into a quiet place to go and focus on studying alone. If I wanted to talk about what I was studying I would go to a starbucks, or one of the other myriad places where I can talk, but since there is a common policy not to be loud or talk too much in a library, I would go there to study.
On top of this, streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime have replaced video rentals. They provide TV and movie content to the masses at an affordable rate. Actual video rental services like Blockbuster have gone completely out of business.
This does not seem like something a library ever fully functioned as, at least not for those who were at least slightly above the poverty line. Granted, this article seems to be written for people who are upper middle class at least but whatever. If we wanted to be empathetic to people who cannot even afford video rented or internet, the library is a good thing to have.
Then there’s the rise of digital technology. Technology has turned physical books into collector’s items, effectively eliminating the need for library borrowing services.
This is actually one I would contest as a point against the library but not contest the validity of the claim that ebooks are replacing print. Emerald insight does point out that ebooks have replaced print by being the most reserved in academic libraries . Meaning that even if we replace all printed books with an electronic equivalent that would not replace the function of libraries, as we would still have to have some means of acquiring ebooks. And even then, we can find a study that ""support[s] the notion that ebooks have firmly established a place in people's lives, but are not yet positioned to take over all the roles of print books. Both print books and ebooks have unique attributes and serve irreplaceable functions in meeting people's reading needs, which may vary by individual demographic, contextual, and situational factors. . So, in the end, this is a moot point even if true.
r. Amazon have created their own online library that has made it easy for the masses to access both physical and digital copies of books. Amazon Books is a chain of bookstores that does what Amazon originally intended to do; replace the local bookstore. It improves on the bookstore model by adding online searches and coffee shops. Amazon Go basically combines a library with a Starbucks.
At the core, Amazon has provided something better than a local library without the tax fees. This is why Amazon should replace local libraries. The move would save taxpayers money and enhance the stockholder value of Amazon all in one fell swoop.
And then there is this point which is dealt with in the article. I can add that I go to the library to research some things that cannot be easily acquired on amazon. And in fact a book on amazon that could cost anywhere from 14-50 dollars would be free at a library. Add into this the fact that I could read a whole library worth of books for what amounts to $45 dollars a year - the cost of just the one book that I linked to - means that the Library provides an extraordinary benefit to the community, especially ones that are not as rich as others."

I’m sure we’d all much prefer amazon running all the libraries. Always having everything in stock because they can cuz it’s amazon and they have the capital to do so. In fact, get rid of all those libraries, transfer all those library cards to Amazon memberships and just use the online picking the books, shipped to you, and then mail it back when it’s done and pick other books or stuff. Either way, get rid of the physical libraries and save all the people taxes for stuff they really want.

I will not be returning to DA again. I'll continue to create art, and certainly write (you will definitely see my literary works on Amazon in time), written solo pieces and collaborative efforts with those I keep close to my heart.

This is my calling, it always has been. DA was merely a phase of my young life that has - much to my relief - come to a close.

June data on retail spending looks set to confirm a strong first half of the year as a resurgent economy, falling prices and higher personal income see more spending at the till. Photograph: Bryan O’Brien Results: Ryanair , Alphabet , Whirlpool , Hasbro . Indicators: Euro-zone consumer confidence flash (Jul). Ryanair investors only have to look at the line of striking pilots outside Dublin airport recently to wonder if the budget airline’s guaranteed returns are a thing of the past, relatively speaking. Reporting first-quarter results on Monday, its own industrial relations problems as well as those elsewhere – air-traffic control strikes leading to other flight cancellations – will be to the fore of shareholder thoughts. Still, it takes more than that to deal much of a blow to confidence. Ahead of the Ryanair numbers, Davy has predicted net income of €304 million and full-year estimates of €1,314 million against guidance of between €1,250 million and €1,350 million. “We expect underlying ancillary revenues to be strong (we assume 9 per cent per pax for the year) and reported ancillary numbers to be even stronger in H1,” it said. Last week, however, Ryanair confirmed the cancellation of further flights between Ireland and the UK due to strike action, a new and unwelcome experience for management. That followed an earlier one-day stoppage. About 100 of Ryanair’s 350 pilots in Ireland are now members of the Irish Airlines Pilots’ Association. Tuesday Results: Hammerson , Virgin Money Holdings, JetBlue, AT&T, Chubb , Harley Davidson. Indicators: Euro-zone composite, marketing and services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) flash (Jul); German composite, marketing and services PMI flash (Jul); US house price index (May), composite, marketing and services PMI flash (Jul). Meetings: Icon agm (South County Business Park , Leopardstown , Dublin 18). Wednesday Indicators: Euro-zone loan growth and money supply (Jun); UK finance mortgage approvals (Jun), business optimism index (Q3); German business climate, current conditions and expectations (Jul). Thursday Results: Intel , Ardagh Group, Howden Joinery , Bristol Myers Squibb , Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Saint-Gobain Group, Amazon , American Airlines , Under Armour , McDonald’s, Xerox , Starbucks , Expedia , Mastercard, Spotify . Indicators: Irish overseas travel (Jun); euro-zone deposit facility rate, marginal lending rate; German consumer confidence (Aug). Meetings: European Central Bank interest rate decision; Dublin Chamber Tourism briefing and networking event (Dublin Chamber, Clare Street, Dublin 2). Friday Indicators: Irish retail sales (Jun); US nationwide housing prices (Jul), GDP (Q2). Meetings: Cork Chamber summer garden party ( Maryborough Hotel gardens, Douglas, Co Cork). June data on retail spending looks set to confirm a strong first half of the year as the combination of a resurgent economy, falling prices and higher personal income see more and more spending at the till. In May, core retail sales rose by 1.5 per cent, up 4.7 per cent on the year. Retail prices were simultaneously dropping, down 1 per cent for the year. In a note last month, Davy said a “solid increase” was likely for the first six months, predicting overall growth of 3.2 per cent for the year and 3 per cent in 2019. “Once again the best-performing sectors are those which suffered badly during the recession, big-ticket items and discretionary purchases, where spending is now bouncing back,” it reported. Sales of hardware paints and glass were up, aided by the recovery in homebuilding activity. Furniture and lighting saw rises too, as did electrical goods. Department store sales grew by 6.4 per cent and non-specialised stores including supermarkets saw gains of 4.8 per cent. However, Friday’s figures, while welcome, will come as other factors such as Brexit and online shopping continue to put pressure on traditional shops. Retail Excellence, the largest of the representative organisations, recently called for “targeted solutions” for retailers in October’s budget, including additional online supports and “tax fairness measures”."

That's my take, which could be entirely wrong, but only David Lynch knows for sure. So..you're saying that even before she came out to Hollywood, she was planning this?
Or is that a flashback also?
I'll have to think on that..sounds plausible.

The skills, discipline, standard and professionalism should be on all the time though.
I am a former Reserve TPU soldier with 2 years AD under MEDDAC and TRADOC. I am now AGR in the Reserves. I see two major flaws with the new APFT.
1. You cannot practice the new test anywhere, anytime. Sure, you can get a medicine ball for cheap or use sandbags to toss but a deadlift set up... Not cheap even on the cheap.
Used plates in my area, when I can find them are $0.40-0.75 a pound. I have looked at super shitty used bars for $50 but I've seen slightly less shitty new bars on Amazon for around the same price. If you wand to build a platform itll run about $250 if you use your military discount at Home Depot. Or you can use 4 horse stall mats for about $100. Still, if a soldier bought all this, they are still limited with using it at home only. A majority of soldiers travel amd hour or more to drill so even if the unit left enough equipment out for soldiers to use, it wouldnt be used much. Some units dont even have space for a small gym. Out of 560 soldiers in my battalion, about 150 to 200 of those can barely afford the gas to come to drill.
2. THE DEADLIFT...
Let me preface that I have a background in bodybilding and have been dabbling in powerlifting for the last year. I also have a medical background with a good chunk of my education spent on gross anatomy and body mechanics.
The deadlift is a highly technical lift that a majority of people perform incorrectly. Sure any schmo should be able to grip and rip their bodyweight with a relatively low risk of injury but we all know these couch potatos or desk jockeys are gonna pound a couple scoops of pre workout monsters and try for 300 or heaven forbid the max when they have no busines attempting that weight. This is asking for hernias and herniated disks and someay have vaso vagal responses and pass TF out and hurt their dome.
Each lifter also has a unique deadlift set up due to their body habitus, height, grip preferences and stance preference. Im going to assume the Army will push out a standardized set up which can cause injury. Max or min foot width, overhand, hook or mixed grip and knee and hip angle standards. Sumo lifters are gonna love it... Not. There is no cookie cutter set up amd the the fatty who can't even do 20lb dumbell curls has no business judging technique and neither does the endurance runner who's never met the free weights. The deadlift is just a recipe for disaster.

Operation Mockingbird -
The Subversion Of America's
Free Press By The CIA 3-24-00
 ""You could get a journalist cheaper than a good call girl, for a couple hundred dollars a month."" CIA operative discussing with Philip Graham, editor Washington Post, on the availability and prices of journalists willing to peddle CIA propaganda and cover stories. ""Katherine The Great,"" by Deborah Davis (New York: Sheridan Square Press, 1991)
 As terrible as it is to live in a nation where the press in known to be controlled by the government, at least one has the advantage of knowing the bias is present, and to adjust for it. In the United States of America, we are taught from birth that our press is free from such government meddling. This is an insideous lie about the very nature of the news institution in this country. One that allows the government to lie to us while denying the very fact of the lie itself. The Alex Constantine Article
Tales from the Crypt The Depraved Spies and Moguls of the CIA's Operation MOCKINGBIRD
By Alex Constantine Who Controls the Media? Soulless corporations do, of course. Corporations with grinning, double-breasted executives, interlocking directorates, labor squabbles and flying capital. Dow. General Electric. Coca-Cola. Disney. Newspapers should have mastheads that mirror the world: The Westinghouse Evening Scimitar, The Atlantic-Richfield Intelligentser . It is beginning to dawn on a growing number of armchair ombudsmen that the public print reports news from a parallel universe - one that has never heard of politically-motivated assassinations, CIA-Mafia banking thefts, mind control, death squads or even federal agencies with secret budgets fattened by cocaine sales - a place overrun by lone gunmen, where the CIA and Mafia are usually on their best behavior. In this idyllic land, the most serious infraction an official can commit __is a the employment of a domestic servant with (shudder) no residency status. This unlikely land of enchantment is the creation of MOCKINGBIRD. It was conceived in the late 1940s, the most frigid period of the cold war, when the CIA began a systematic infiltration of the corporate media, a process that often included direct takeover of major news outlets. In this period, the American intelligence services competed with communist activists abroad to influence European labor unions. With or without the cooperation of local governments, Frank Wisner, an undercover State Department official assigned to the Foreign Service, rounded up students abroad to enter the cold war underground of covert operations on behalf of his Office of Policy Coordination. Philip Graham, __a graduate of the Army Intelligence School in Harrisburg, PA, then publisher of the Washington Post., was taken under Wisner's wing to direct the program code-named Operation MOCKINGBIRD. ""By the early 1950s,"" writes formerVillage Voice reporter Deborah Davis in Katharine the Great, ""Wisner 'owned' respected members of the New York Times, Newsweek, CBS and other communications vehicles, plus stringers, four to six hundred in all, according to a former CIA analyst."" The network was overseen by Allen Dulles, a templar for German and American corporations who wanted their points of view represented in the public print. Early MOCKINGBIRD influenced 25 newspapers and wire agencies consenting to act as organs of CIA propaganda. Many of these were already run by men with reactionary views, among them William Paley (CBS), C.D. Jackson (Fortune), Henry Luce (Time) and Arthur Hays Sulzberger (N.Y. Times). Activists curious about the workings of MOCKINGBIRD have since been appalled to f__ind in FOIA documents that agents boasting in CIA office memos of their pride in having placed ""important assets"" inside every major news publication in the country. It was not until 1982 that the Agency openly admitted that reporters on the CIA payroll have acted as case officers to agents in the field. ""World War III has begun,"" Henry's Luce's Life declared in March, 1947. ""It is in the opening skirmish stage already."" The issue featured an excerpt of a book by James Burnham, who called for the creation of an ""American Empire,"" ""world-dominating in political power, set up at least in part through coercion (probably including war, but certainly the threat of war) and in which one group of people ... would hold more than its equal share of power."" George Seldes, the famed anti-fascist media critic, drew down on Luce in 1947, explaining tha__t ""although avoiding typical Hitlerian phrases, the same doctrine of a superior people taking over the world and ruling it, began to appear in the press, whereas the organs of Wall Street were much more honest in favoring a doctrine inevitably leading to war if it brought greater commercial markets under the American flag."" On the domestic front, an abiding relationship was struck between the CIA and William Paley, a wartime colonel and the founder of CBS. A firm believer in ""all forms of propaganda"" to foster loyalty to the Pentagon, Paley hired CIA agents to work undercover at the behest of his close friend, the busy grey eminence of the nation's media, Allen Dulles. Paley's designated go-between in his dealings with the CIA was Sig Mickelson, president of CBS News from 1954 to 1961. The CIA's assimilation of old guard fascists was overseen by the Operations Coordination Board, directed by C.D. Jackson, formerly an executive of Time magazine and Eisenhower's Special Assistant for Cold War Strategy. In 1954 he was succeeded by Nelson Rockefeller, who quit a year later, disgusted at the administration's political infighting. Vice President Nixon succeeded Rockefeller as the key cold war strategist. ""Nixon,"" writes John Loftus, a former attorney for the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, took ""a small boy's delight in the arcane tools of the intelligence craft - the hidden microphones, the 'black' propaganda."" Nixon especially enjoyed his visit to a Virginia training camp to observe Nazis in the ""special forces"" drilling at covert operations. One of the fugitives recruited by the American intelligence underground was heroin smuggler Hubert von Blcher, the son of A German ambassador. Hubert often bragged that that he was trained by the Abwehr, the German military intelligence division, while still a civilian in his twenties. He served in a recon unit of the German Army until forced out for medical reasons in 1944, according to his wartime records. He worked briefly as an assistant director for Berlin-Film on a movie entitled One Day ..., and finished out the war flying with the Luftwaffe, but not to engage the enemy - his mission was the smuggling of Nazi loot out of the country. His exploits were, in part, the subject of Sayer and Botting's Nazi Gold, an account of the knockover of the Reichsbank at the end of the war. In 1948 he flew the coop to Argentina. Posing as a photographer named Huberto von Bleucher Corell, he immediately paid court to Eva Peron, presenting her with an invaluable Gobelin tapestry (a selection from the wealth of artifacts confiscated by the SS from Europe's Jews?). Hubert then met with Martin Bormann at the Hotel Plaza to deliver German marks worth $80 million. The loot financed the birth of the National Socialist Party in Argentina, among other forms of Nazi revival. In 1951, Hubert migrated northward and took a job at the Color Corporation of America in Hollywood. He eked out a living writing scripts for the booming movie industry. His voice can be heard on a film set in the Amazon, produced by Walt Disney. Nine years later he returned to Buenos Aires, then Dsseldorf, West Germany, and established a firm that developed not movie scripts, but anti-chemical warfare agents for the government. At the Industrie Club in Dsseldorf in 1982, von Blcher boasted to journalists, ""I am chief shareholder of Pan American Airways. I am the best friend of Howard Hughes. The Beach Hotel in Las Vegas is 45 percent financed by me. I am thus the biggest financier ever to appear in the Arabian Nights tales dreamed up by these people over their second bottle of brandy."" Not really. Two the biggest financiers to stumble from the drunken dreams of world-moving affluence were, in their time, Moses Annenberg, publisher of The Philadelphia Inquirer, and his son Walter , the CIA/mob-anchored publisher of the TV Guide. Like most American high-rollers, Annenberg lived a double life. Moses, his father, was a scion of the Capone mob. Both Moses and Walter were indicted in 1939 for tax evasions totalling many millions of dollars - the biggest case in the history of the Justice Department. Moses pled guilty and agreed to pay the government $8 million and settle $9 million in assorted tax claims, penalties and interest debts. Moses received a three-year sentence. He died in Lewisburg Penitentiary. Walter Annenbeg, the TV Guide magnate, was a lofty Republican. On the campaign trail in April, 1988, George Bush flew into Los Angeles to woo Reagan's kitchen cabinet. ""This is the topping on the cake,"" Bush's regional campaign director told the Los Angeles Times. The Bush team met at Annenberg's plush Rancho Mirage estate at Sunnylands, California. It was at the Annenberg mansion that Nixon's cabinet was chosen, and the state's social and contributor registers built over a quarter-century of state political dominance by Ronald Reagan, whose acting career was launched by Operation MOCKINGBIRD. The commercialization of television, coinciding with Reagan's recruitment by the Crusade for Freedom, a CIA front, presented the intelligence world with unprecedented potential for sowing propaganda and even prying in the age of Big Brother. George Orwell glimpsed the possibilities when he installed omniscient video surveillance technology in 1948, a novel rechristened 1984 for the first edition published in the U.S. by Harcourt, Brace. Operation Octopus, according to federal files, was in full swing by 1948, a surveillance program that turned any television set with tubes into a broadcast transmitter. Agents of Octopus could pick up audio and visual images with the equipment as far as 25 miles away. Hale Boggs was investigating Operation Octopus at the time of his disappearance in the midst of the Watergate probe. In 1952, at MCA, Actors' Guild president Ronald Reagan - a screen idol recruited by MOCKINGBIRD's Crusade for Freedom to raise funds for the resettlement of Nazis in the U.S., according to Loftus - signed a secret waiver of the conflict-of-interest rule with the mob-controlled studio, in effect granting it a labor monopoly on early television programming. In exchange, MCA made Reagan a part owner. Furthermore, historian C. Vann Woodward, writing in the New York Times, in 1987, reported that Reagan had ""fed the names of suspect people in his organization to the FBI secretly and regularly enough to be assigned 'an informer's code number, T-10.' His FBI file indicates intense collaboration with producers to 'purge' the industry of subversives."" No one ever turned a suspicious eye on Walter Cronkite, a former intelligence officer and in the immediate postwar period UPI's Moscow correspondent. Cronkite was lured to CBS by Operation MOCKINGBIRD's Phil Graham, according to Deborah Davis. Another television conglomerate, Cap Cities, rose like a horror-film simian from CIA and Mafia heroin operations. Among other organized-crime Republicans, Thomas Dewey and his neighbor Lowell Thomas threw in to launch the infamous Resorts International, the corporate front for Lansky's branch of the federally-sponsored mob family and the corporate precursor to Cap Cities. Another of the investors was James Crosby, a Cap Cities executive who donated $100,000 to Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign. This was the year that Resorts bought into Atlantic City casino interests. Police in New jersey attempted, with no success, to spike the issuance of a gambling license to the company, citing Mafia ties. In 1954, this same circle of investors, all Catholics, founded the broadcasting company notorious for overt propagandizing and general spookiness. The company's chief counsel was OSS veteran William Casey, who clung to his shares by concealing them in a blind trust even after he was appointed CIA director by Ronald Reagan in 1981. ""Black radio"" was the phrase CIA critic David Wise coined in The Invisible Government to describe the agency's intertwining interests in the emergence of the transistor radio with the entrepreneurs who took to the airwaves. ""Daily, East and West beam hundreds of propaganda broadcasts at each other in an unrelenting babble of competition for the minds of their listeners. The low-price transistor has given the hidden war a new importance,"" enthused one foreign correspondent. A Hydra of private foundations sprang up to finance the propaganda push. One of them, Operations and Policy Research, Inc. (OPR), received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the CIA through private foundations and trusts. OPR research was the basis of a television series that aired in New York and Washington, D.C. in 1964, Of People and Politics, a ""study"" of the American political system in 21 weekly installments. In Hollywood, the visual cortex of The Beast, the same CIA/Mafia combination that formed Cap Cities sank its claws into the film studios and labor unions. Johnny Rosselli was pulled out of the Army during the war by a criminal investigation of Chicago mobsters in the film industry. Rosselli, a CIA asset probably assassinated by the CIA, played sidekick to Harry Cohn, the Columbia Pictures mogul who visited Italy's Benito Mussolini in 1933, and upon his return to Hollywood remodeled his office after the dictator's. The only honest job Rosselli ever had was assistant purchasing agent (and a secret investor) at Eagle Lion productions, run by Bryan Foy, a former producer for 20th Century Fox. Rosselli, Capone's representative on the West Coast, passed a small fortune in mafia investments to Cohn. Bugsy Seigel pooled gambling investments with Billy Wilkerson, publisher of the Hollywood Reporter. In the 1950s, outlays for global propaganda climbed to a full third of the CIA's covert operations budget. Some 3, 000 salaried and contract CIA employees were eventually engaged in propaganda efforts. The cost of disinforming the world cost American taxpayers an estimated $265 million a year by 1978, a budget larger than the combined expenditures of Reuters, UPI and the AP news syndicates. In 1977, the Copely News Service admitted that it worked closely with the intelligence services - in fact, 23 employees were full-time employees of the Agency. Most consumers of the corporate media were - and are - unaware of the effect that the salting of public opinion has on their own beliefs. A network anchorman in time of national crisis is an instrument of psychological warfare in the MOCKINGBIRD media. He is a creature from the national security sector's chamber of horrors. For this reason consumers of the corporate press have reason to examine their basic beliefs about government and life in the parallel universe of these United States. How the Washington Post Censors the News [Note: Look for the paragraph indicated by asterisks] How the Washington Post Censors the News A Letter to the Washington Post by Julian C. Holmes April 25, 1992 Richard Harwood, Ombudsman The Washington Post 1150 15th Street NW Washington, DC 20071 Dear Mr. Harwood, Though the Washington Post does not over-extend itself in the pursuit of hard news, just let drop the faintest rumor of a government ""conspiracy"", and a klaxon horn goes off in the news room. Aroused from apathy in the daily routine of reporting assignations and various other political and social sports events, editors and reporters scramble to the phones. The klaxon screams its warning: the greatest single threat to herd-journalism, corporate profits, and government stability -- the dreaded ""CONSPIRACY THEORY""!! It is not known whether anyone has actually been hassled or accosted by any of these frightful spectres, but their presence is announced to Post readers with a salvo of warnings to avoid the tricky, sticky webs spun by the wacko ""CONSPIRACY THEORISTS"". Recall how the Post saved us from the truth about Iran-Contra. Professional conspiracy exorcist Mark Hosenball was hired to ridicule the idea that Oliver North and his CIA-associated gangsters had conspired to do wrong (*1). And when, in their syndicated column, Jack Anderson and Dale Van Atta discussed some of the conspirators, the Post sprang to protect its readers, and the conspirators, by censoring the Anderson column before printing it (*2). But for some time the lid had been coming off the Iran-Contra conspiracy. In 1986, the Christic Institute, an interfaith center for law and public policy, had filed a lawsuit alleging a U.S. arms-for-drugs trade that helped keep weapons flowing to the CIA-Contra army in Nicaragua, and cocaine flowing to U.S. markets (*3). In 1988 Leslie Cockburn published Out of Control, a seminal work on our bizarre, illegal war against Nicaragua (*4). The Post contributed to this discovery process by disparaging the charges of conspiracy and by publishing false information about the drug-smuggling evidence presented to the House Subcommittee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. When accused by Committee Chairman Charles Rangel (D-NY). of misleading reporting, the Post printed only a partial correction and declined to print a letter of complaint from Rangel (*5). Sworn testimony before Senator John Kerry's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations confirmed U.S. Government complicity in the drug trade (*6). With its coverup of the arms/drug conspiracy evaporating, the ever-accommodating Post shifted gears and retained Hosenball to exorcise from our minds a newly emerging threat to domestic tranquility, the ""October Surprise"" conspiracy (*7). But close on the heels of Hosenball and the Post came Barbara Honegger and then Gary Sick who authored independently, two years apart, books with the same title, ""October Surprise"" (*8). Honegger was a member of the Reagan/Bush campaign and transition teams in 1980. Gary Sick, professor of Middle East Politics at Columbia University, was on the staff of the National Security Council under Presidents Ford, Carter, and Reagan. In 1989 and 1991 respectively, Honegger and Sick published their evidence of how the Republicans made a deal to supply arms to Iran if Iran would delay release of the 52 United States hostages until after the November 1980 election. The purpose of this deal was to quash the possibility of a pre-election release(an October surprise). which would have bolstered the reelection prospects for President Carter. Others published details of this alleged Reagan-Bush conspiracy. In October 1988, Playboy Magazine ran an expose ""An Election Held Hostage""; FRONTLINE did another in April 1991 (*9). In June, 1991 a conference of distinguished journalists, joined by 8 of the former hostages, challenged the Congress to ""make a full, impartial investigation"" of the election/hostage allegations. The Post reported the statement of the hostages, but not a word of the conference itself which was held in the Dirksen Senate Office Building Auditorium (*10). On February 5, 1992 a gun-shy, uninspired House of Representatives begrudgingly authorized an ""October Surprise"" investigation by a task force of 13 congressmen headed by Lee Hamilton (D-IN). who had chaired the House of Representatives Iran-Contra Committee. Hamilton has named as chief team counsel Larry Barcella, a lawyer who represented BCCI when the Bank was indicted in 1988 (*11). Like the Washington Post, Hamilton had not shown interest in pursuing the U.S. arms-for-drugs operation (*12). He had accepted Oliver North's lies,and as Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee he derailed House Resolution 485 which had asked President Reagan to answer questions about Contra support activities of government officials and others (*13). After CIA operative John Hull (from Hamilton's home state). was charged in Costa Rica with ""international drug trafficking and hostile acts against the nation's security"", Hamilton and 18 fellow members of Congress tried to intimidate Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez into handling Hull's case ""in a manner that will not complicate U.S.-Costa Rican relations"" (*14). The Post did not report the Hamilton letter or the Costa Rican response that declared Hull's case to be ""in as good hands as our 100 year old uninterrupted democracy can provide to all citizens"" (*15). Though the Post does its best to guide our thinking away from conspiracy theories, it is difficult to avoid the fact that so much wrongdoing involves government or corporate conspiracies: In its COINTELPRO operation, the FBI used disinformation, forgery, surveillance, false arrests, and violence to illegally harass U.S.citizens in the 60's (*16). The CIA's Operation MONGOOSE illegally sabotaged Cuba by ""destroying crops, brutalizing citizens, destabilizing the society, and conspiring with the Mafia to assassinate Fidel Castro and other leaders"" (*17). ""Standard Oil of New Jersey was found by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice to be conspiring with I.G.Farben...of Germany. ...By its cartel agreements with Standard Oil, the United States was effectively prevented from developing or producing [fo rWorld War-II] any substantial amount of synthetic rubber,"" said Senator Robert LaFollette of Wisconsin (*18). U.S. Government agencies knowingly withheld information about dosages of radiation ""almost certain to produce thyroid abnormalities or cancer"" that contaminated people residing near the nuclear weapons factory at Hanford, Washington (*19). Various branches of Government deliberately drag their feet in getting around to cleaning up the Nation's dangerous nuclear weapons sites (*20). State and local governments back the nuclear industry's secret public relations strategy (*21). ""The National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society and some twenty comprehensive cancer centers, have misled and confused the public and Congress by repeated claims that we are winning the war against cancer. In fact, the cancer establishment has continually minimized the evidence for increasing cancer rates which it has largely attributed to smoking and dietary fat, while discounting or ignoring the causal role of avoidable eposures to industrial carcinogens in the air, food, water, and the workplace."" (*22). The Bush Administration coverup of its pre-Gulf-War support of Iraq ""is yet another example of the President's people conspiring to keep both Congress and the American people in the dark"" (*23). If you think about it, conspiracy is a fundamental aspect of doing business in this country. Take the systematic and cooperative censorship of the Persian Gulf War by the Pentagon and much of the news media (*24). Or the widespread plans of business and government groups to spend $100 million in taxes to promote a distorted and truncated history of Columbus in America (*25). along the lines of the Smithsonian Institution's ""fusion of the two worlds"", (*26). rather than examining more realistic aspects of the Spanish invasion, like ""anger, cruelty, gold, terror, and death"" (*27). Or circumstances surrounding the U.S. Justice Department theft from the INSLAW company of sophisticated, law-enforcement computer software which ""now point to a widespread conspiracy implicating lesser Government officials in the theft of INSLAW's technology"", says former U.S. Attorney General Elliot Richardson (*28). Or Watergate. Or the ""largest bank fraud in world financial history"" (*29), where the White House knew of the criminal activities at ""the Bank of Crooks and Criminals International"" (BCCI) (*30), where U.S. intelligence agencies did their secret banking (*31), and where bribery of prominent American public officials ""was a way of doing business"" (*32). Or the 1949 conviction of ""GM [General Motors], Standard Oil of California, Firestone, and E. Roy Fitzgerald, among others, for criminally conspiring to replace electric transportation with gas- and diesel-powered buses and to monopolize the sale of buses and related products to transportation companies throughout the country"" [in, among others, the cities of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, St. Louis, Oakland, Salt Lake City, and Los Angeles] (*33). Or the collusion in 1973 between Senator Abraham Ribicoff (D-CT). and the U.S. Department of Transportation to overlook safety defects in the 1.2 million Corvair automobiles manufactured by General Motors in the early 60's (*34). Or the A. H. Robins Company, which manufactured the Dalkon Shield intrauterine contraceptive, and which ignored repeated warnings of the Shield's hazards and which ""stonewalled, deceived, covered up, and covered up the coverups...[thus inflicting] on women a worldwide epidemic of pelvic infections."" (*35). Or that cooperation between McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Company and the FAA resulted in failure to enforce regulations regarding the unsafe DC-10 cargo door which failed in flight killing all 364 passengers on Turkish Airlines Flight 981 on March 3, 1974 (*36). Or the now-banned, cancer-producing pregnancy drug Diethylstilbestrol (DES). that was sold by manufacturers who ignored tests which showed DES to be carcinogenic; and who acted ""in concert with each other in the testing and marketing of DES for miscarriage purposes"" (*37). Or the conspiracies among bankers and speculators, with the cooperation of a corrupted Congress, to relieve depositors of their savings. This ""arrogant disregard from the White House, Congress and corporate world for the interests and rights of the American people"" will cost U.S. tapayers many hundreds of billions of dollars (*38). Or the Westinghouse, Allis Chalmers,Federal Pacific, and General Electric executives who met surreptitiously in hotel rooms to fix prices and eliminate competition on heavy industrial equipment (*39). Or the convictions of Industrial Biotest Laboratories (IBT). officers for fabricating safety tests on prescription drugs (*40). Or the conspiracy by the asbestos industry to suppress knowledge of medical problemsrelating to asbestos (*41). Or the 1928 Achnacarry Agreement through which oil companies ""agreed not to engage in any effective price competition"" (*42). Or the conspiracy among U.S. Government agencies and the Congress to cover up the nature of our decades-old war against the people of Nicaragua a covert war that continues in 1992 with the U.S. Government applying pressure for the Nicaraguan police to reorganize into a more repressive force (*43). Or the conspiracy by the CIA and the U.S. Government to interfere in the Chilean election process with military aid, covert actions, and an economic boycott which culminated in the overthrow of the legitimately elected government and the assassination of President Salvador Allende in 1973 (*44). Or the conspiracy among U.S. officials including Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and CIA Director William Colby to finance terrorism in Angola for the purpose of disrupting Angola's plans for peaceful elections in October 1975, and to lie about these actions to the Congress and the news media (*45). And CIA Director George Bush's subsequent cover up of this U.S.-sponsored terrorism (*46). Or President George Bush's consorting with the Pentagon to invade Panama in 1989 and thereby violate the Constitution of the United States, the U.N. Charter, the O.A.S. Charter, and the Panama Canal Treaties (*47). Or the ""gross antitrust violations"" (*48) and the conspiracy of American oil companies and the British and U.S. governments to strangle Iran economically after Iran nationalized the British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951. And the subsequent overthrow by the CIA in 1953 of Iranian Prime Minister Muhammed Mossadegh (*49). Or the CIA-planned assassination of Congo head-of-state Patrice Lumumba (*50). Or the deliberate and wilful efforts of President George Bush, Senator Robert Dole, Senator George Mitchell, various U.S. Government agencies, and members of both Houses of the Congress to buy the 1990 Nicaraguan national elections for the presidential candidate supported by President Bush (*51). Or the collective approval by 64 U.S. Senators of Robert Gates to head the CIA, in the face of ""unmistakable evidence that Gates lied about his role in the Iran-Contra scandal"" (*52). Or ""How Reagan and the Pope Conspired to Assist Poland's Solidarity Movement and Hasten the Demise of Communism"" (*53). Or how the Reagan Administration connived with the Vatican to ban the use of USAID funds by any country ""for the promotion of birth control or abortion"" (*54). Or ""the way the Vatican and Washington colluded to achieve common purpose in Central America"" (*55). Or the collaboration of Guatemalan strong-man and mass murderer Hector Gramajo with the U.S. Army to design ""programs to build civilian-military cooperation"" at the U.S. Army School of the Americas (SOA) at Fort Benning, Georgia; five of the nine soldiers accused in the 1989 Jesuit massacre in El Salvador are graduates of SOA which trains Latin/American military personnel (*56). Or the conspiracy of the Comanche Peak Nuclear Plant administration to harass and cause bodily harm to whistleblower Linda Porter who uncovered dangerous working conditions at the facility (*57). Or the conspiracy of President Richard Nxion and the Government of South Vietnam to delay the Paris Peace Talks until after the 1968 U.S. presidential election (*58). Or the pandemic coverups of police violence (*59). Or the always safe-to-cite worldwide communist conspiracy (*60). Or maybe the socially responsible, secret consortium to publish The Satanic Verses in paperback (*61). Conspiracies are obviously a way to get things done, and the Washington Post offers little comment unless conspiracy theorizing threatens to expose a really important conspiracy that, let's say, benefits big business or big government. Such a conspiracy would be like our benevolent CIA's 1953 overthrow of the Iranian government to help out U.S. oil companies; or like our illegal war against Panama to tighten U.S. control over Panama and the Canal; or like monopoly control of broadcasting that facilitates corporate censorship on issues of public importance (*62). When the camouflage of such conspiracies is stripped away, public confidence in the conspiring officials can erode -- depending on how seriously the citizenry perceives the conspiracy to have violated the public trust. Erosion of public trust in the status quo is what the Post seems to see as a real threat to its corporate security. Currently, the Post has mounted vituperative, frenzied attacks on Oliver Stone's movie ""JFK"", which reexamines the U.S. Government's official (Warren Commission. finding that a single gunman, acting alone, killed President John F. Kennedy. The movie also is the story of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's unsuccessful prosecution of Clay Shaw, the only person ever tried in connection with the assassination. And the movie proposes that the Kennedy assassination was the work of conspirators whose interests would not be served by a president who, had he lived, might have disengaged us from our war against Vietnam. The Post ridicules a reexamination of the Kennedy assassination along lines suggested by ""JFK"". Senior Post journalists like Charles Krauthammer, Ken Ringle, George Will, Phil McCombs, and Michael Isikoff, have been called up to man the bulwarks against public sentiment which has never supported the government's non-conspiratorial assassination thesis. In spite of the facts that the Senate Intelligence Committee of 1975 and 1976 found that ""both the FBI and CIA had repeatedly lied to the Warren Commission"" (*63) and that the 1979 Report of the House Select Committee on Assassinations found that President Kennedy was probably killed ""as a result of a conspiracy"" (*64), a truly astounding number of Post stories have been used as vehicles to discredit ""JFK"" as just another conspiracy (*65). Some of the more vicious attacks on the movie are by editor Stephen Rosenfeld, and journalists Richard Cohen, George Will, and George Lardner Jr (*66). They ridicule the idea that Kennedy could have had second thoughts about escalating the Vietnam War and declaim that there is no historical justification for this idea. Seasoned journalist Peter Dale Scott, former Pentagon/CIA liaison chief L. Fletcher Prouty, and investigators David Scheim and John Newman have each authored defense of the ""JFK"" thesis that Kennedy was not enthusiastic about staying in Vietnam (*67). But the Post team just continues ranting against the possibility of a high-level assassination conspiracy while offering little justification for its arguments. An example of particularly shabby scholarship and unacceptable behavior is George Lardner Jr's contribution to the Post's campaign against the movie. Lardner wrote three articles, two before the movie was completed, and the third upon its release. In May, six months before the movie came out, Lardner obtained a copy of the first draft of the script and, contrary to accepted standards, revealed in the Post the contents of this copyrighted movie (*68). Also in this article, (*69). Lardner discredits Jim Garrison with hostile statements from a former Garrison associate Pershing Gervais. Lardner does not tell the reader that subsequent to the Clay Shaw trial, in a U.S. Government criminal action brought against Garrison, Government witness Gervais, who helped set up Garrison for prosecution, admitted under oath that in a May 1972 interview with a New Orleans television reporter, he, Gervais, had said that the U.S. Government's case against Garrison was a fraud (*70). The Post's 1973 account of the Garrison acquittal mentions this controversy, but when I recently asked Lardner about this, he was not clear as to whether he remembered it (*71). Two weeks after his first ""JFK"" article, Lardner blustered his way through a justification for his unauthorized possession of the early draft ofthe movie (*72). He also defended his reference to Pershing Gervais by lashing out at Garrison as a writer ""of gothic fiction"". When the movie was released in December, Lardner ""reviewed"" it (*73). He again ridiculed the film's thesis that following the Kennedy assassination, President Johnson reversed Kennedy's plans to de-escalate the Vietnam War. Lardner cited a memorandum issued by Johnson four days after Kennedy died. Lardner says this memorandum was written before the assassination, and that it ""was a continuation of Kennedy's policy"". In fact, the memorandum was drafted the day before the assassination by McGeorge Bundy (Kennedy's Assistant for National Security Affairs) Kennedy was in Texas, and may never have seen it. Following the assassination, it was rewritten; and the final version provided for escalating the war against Vietnam (*74) -- facts that Lardner avoided. The Post's crusade against exposing conspiracies is blatantly dishonest: The Warren Commission inquiry into the Kennedy Assassination was for the most part conducted in secret. This fact is buried in the Post (*75). Nor do current readers of this newspaper find meaningful discussion of the Warren Commission's secret doubts about both the FBI and the CIA (*76). Or of a dispatch from CIA headquarters instructing co-conspirators at field stations to counteract the ""new wave of books and articles criticizing the [Warren] Commission's findings...[and] conspiracy theories ...[that] have frequently thrown suspicion on our organization"" and to ""discuss the publicity problem with liaison and friendly elite contacts, especially politicians and editors ""and to ""employ propaganda assets to answer and refute the attacks of the critics. ...Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose. ...The aim of this dispatch is to provide material for countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists..."" (*77). In 1979, Washington journalist Deborah Davis published Katharine The Great, the story of Post publisher Katharine Graham and her newspaper's close ties with Washington's powerful elite, a number of whom were with the CIA. Particularly irksome to Post editor Benjamin Bradlee was a Davis claim that Bradlee had ""produced CIA material"" (*78). Understandably sensitive about this kind of publicity, Bradlee told Davis' publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ,""Miss Davis is lying ...I never produced CIA material ...what I can do is to brand Miss Davis as a fool and to put your company in that special little group of publishers who don't give a shit for the truth"". The Post bullied HBJ into recalling the book; HBJ shredded 20,000 copies; Davis sued HBJ for breach of contract and damage to reputation; HBJ settled out of court; and Davis published her book elsewhere with an appendix that demonstrated Bradlee to have been deeply involved with producing cold-war/CIA propaganda (*79). Bradlee still says the allegations about his association with people in the CIA are false, but he has apparently taken no action to contest the xetensive documentation presented by Deborah Davis in the second and third editions of her book (*80). And it's not as if the Post were new to conspiracy work. Former Washington Post publisher Philip Graham ""believing that the function of the press was more often than not to mobilize consent for the policies of the government, was one of the architects of what became a widespread practice:the use and manipulation of journalists by the CIA"" (*81). This scandal was known by its code name Operation MOCKINGBIRD. Former Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein cites a former CIA deputy director as saying, ""It was widely known that Phil Graham was someone you could get help from"" (*82). More recently the Post provided cover for CIA personality Joseph Fernandez by ""refusing to print his name for over a year up until the day his indictmen twas announced ...for crimes committed in his official capacity as CIA station chief in Costa Rica"" (*83). Of the meetings between Graham and his CIA acquaintances at which the availability and prices of journalists were discussed, a former CIA man recalls, ""You could get a journalist cheaper than a good call girl, for a couple hundred dollars a month"" (*84). One may wish to consider Philip Graham's philosophy along with a more recent statement from his wife Katharine Graham, current Chairman of the Board of the Washington Post. In a lecture on terrorism and the news media, Mrs. Graham said: ""A second challenge facing the media is how to prevent terrorists from using the media as a platform fortheir views. ... The point is that we generally know when we are being manipulated, and we've learned better how and where to draw the line, though the decisions are often difficult"" (*85). Today, the Post and its world of big business are apparently terrified that our elite and our high-level public officials may be exposed as conspirators behind Contra drug-smuggling, October Surprise, or the assassination of President Kennedy. This fear is truly remarkable in that, like most of us and like most institutions, the Post runs its business as a conspiracy of like-minded entrepreneurs -- a conspiracy ""to act or work together toward the same result or goal"" (*86). But where the Post really parts company from just plain people is when it pretends that conspiracies associated with big business or government are ""coincidence"". Post reporter Lardner vents the frustration inherent in having to maintain this dichotomy. He lashes out at Oliver Stone and suggests that Stone may actually believe that the Post's opposition to Stone's movie is a ""conspiracy"". Lardner assures us that Stone's complaints are ""groundless and paranoid and smack of McCarthyism"" (*87). So how does the Post justify devoting so much energy to ridiculing those who investigate conspiracies? The Post has answers: people revert to conspiracy theories because they need something ""neat and tidy"" (*88) that ""plugs a gap no other generally accepted theory fills', (*89. and ""coincidence ...is always the safest and most likely explanation for any conjunction of curious circumstances ..."" (*90). And what does this response mean? It means that ""coincidence theory"" is what the Post espouses when it would prefer not to admit to a conspiracy. In other words, some things just ""happen"". And, besides, conspiracy to do certain things would be a crime; ""coincidence"" is a safer bet. Post Ombudsman Richard Harwood, who, it is rumored, serves as Executive Director of the Benevolent Protective Order of Coincidence Theorists, (*91) recently issued a warning about presidential candidates ""who have begun to mutter about a press conspiracy"". Ordinarily, Harwood would simply dismiss these charges as ""symptoms of the media paranoia that quadrennially engulfs members of the American political class"" (*92). But a fatal mistake was made by the mutterers; they used the ""C"" word against the PRESS! And Harwood exploded his off-the-cuff comment into an entire column -- ending it with:""We are the new journalists, immersed too long, perhaps, in the cleansing waters of political conformity. But conspirators we ain't"". Distinguished investigative journalist Morton Mintz, a 29-year veteran of the Washington Post, now chairs the Fund for Investigative Journalism. In the December issue of The Progressive, Mintz wrote ""A Reporter Looks Back in Anger -- Why the Media Cover Up Corporate Crime"". Therein he discussed the difficulties in convincing editors to accept important news stories. He illustrated the article with his own experiences at the Post, where he says he was known as ""the biggest pain in the ass in the office"" (*93). Would Harwood argue that grief endured by journalists at the hands of editors is a matter of random coincidence? And that such policy as Mintz described is made independently by editors without influence from fellow editors or from management? Would Harwood have us believe that at the countless office ""meetings"" in which news people are ever in attendance, there is no discussion of which stories will run and which ones will find inadequate space? That there is no advanced planning for stories or that there are no cooperative efforts among the staff? Or that in the face of our news-media ""grayout"" of presidential candidate Larry Agran, (*94) a Post journalist would be free to give news space to candidate Agran equal to that the Post lavishes on candidate Clinton? Let's face it: these possibilities are about as likely as Barbara Bush entertaining guests at a soup kitchen. Would Harwood have us believe that media critic and former Post Ombudsman Ben Bagdikian is telling less than the truth in his account of wire-service control over news: ""The largely anonymous men who control the syndicate and wire service copy desks and the central wire photo machines determine at a single decision what millions will see and hear. ...there seems to be little doubt that these gatekeepers preside over an operation in which an appalling amount of press agentry sneaks in the back door of American journalism and marches untouched out the front door as 'news'"" (*95). When he sat on the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington, Judge Clarence Thomas violated U.S. law when he failed to remove himself from a case in which he then proceeded to reverse a $10 million judgment against the Ralston Purina Company (*96). Ralston Purina, the animal feed empire, is the family fortune of Thomas' mentor, Senator John Danforth. The Post limited its coverage of the Thomas malfeasance to 56 words buried in the middle of a 1200-word article (*97). Would Harwood have us believe that the almost complete blackout on this matter by the major news media and the U.S. Senate was a matter of coincidence? Could a Post reporter have written a story about Ralston Purina if she had wanted to? Can a brick swim? Or take the fine report produced last September by Ralph Nader's Public Citizen. Titled All the Vice President's Men, it documents ""How the Quayle Council on Competitiveness Secretly Undermines Health, Safety, and Environmental Programs"". Three months later, Post journalists David Broder and Bob Woodward published ""The President's Understudy"", a seven-part series on Vice President Quayle. Although this series does address Quayle's role with the Competitiveness Council, its handling of the Council's disastrous impact on America is inadequate. It is 40,000 words of mostly aimless chatter about Quayle memorabilia: youth, family, college record, Christianity, political aspirations, intellectual aspirations, wealthy friends, government associates, golf, travels, wife Marilyn, and net worth -- revealing little about Quayle's abilities, his understanding of society's problems, or his thoughts about justice and freedom, and never mentioning the comprehensive Nader study of Quayle's record in the Bush Administration (*98). Now, did Broder or did Woodward forget about the Nader study? Or did both of them forget? Or did one, or the other, or both decide not to mention it? Did these two celebrated, seasoned Post reporters ever discuss together their jointly authored stories? Did they decide to publish such a barren set of articles because it would enhance their reputations? How did management feel about the use of precious news space for such frivolity? Is it possible that so many pages were dedicated to this twaddle without people ""acting or working together toward the same result or goal""? (*99) Do crocodiles fly? On March 20, front-page headlines in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, USA Today, and the Washington Post read respectively: TSONGAS DROPPED OUT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE CLEARING CLINTON'S PATH TSONGAS ABANDONS CAMPAIGN LEAVING CLINTON CLEAR PATH TOWARD SHOWDOWN WITH BUSH TSONGAS CLEARS WAY FOR CLINTON TSONGAS EXIT CLEARS WAY FOR CLINTON This display of editorial independence should at least raise questions of whether the news media collective mindset is really different from that of any other cartel -- like oil, diamond, energy, (*100) or manufacturing cartels, a cartel being ""a combination of independent commercial enterprises designed to limit competition"" (*101). The Washington Post editorial page carries the heading: AN INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER Is it? Of course not. There probably is no such thing. Does the Post ""conspire"" to keep its staff and its newspaper from wandering too far from the safety of mediocrity? The Post would respond that the question is absurd. In that I am not privy to the Post's telephone conversations, I can only speculate on how closely the media elite must monitor the staff. But we all know how few micro-seconds it takes a new reporter to learn what subjects are taboo and what are ""safe"", and that experienced reporters don't have to ask. What is more important, however, than speculating about how the Post communicates within its own corporate structure and with other members of the cartel, is to document and publicize what the Post does in public, namely, how it shapes and censors the news.

""cartel"", Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, 1977. NOTES A good source on the Washington Post and Katharine Graham's attempt to suppress the Davis book,""Katherine The Great,"", which was largely successful, is Carol Felsenthal's, ""Power and Privilege at the Post, the Katharine Graham Story."" For more information on Johnny Rosselli and Moses and Walter Annenberg, an excellent source is ""All American Mafioso, the Johnny Rosselli Story,"" by Ed Becker and Charles Rappelye. An additional good short reference is ""The CIA's Greatest Hits"" by Mark Zepezauer. There you will find the reference to Carl Bernstein's classic ""The CIA and the Media"" which appeared in Rolling Stone on Oct. 20, 1977. Still another recent example of the CIA's control of the media is the spiking of Sally Denton's & Roger Morris' story,""THE CRIMES OF MENA"" by Washington Post managing editor Bob Kaiser even though the story had been legally vetted and cleared for publication. Indeed the story, which details the CIA's involvement in drug trafficing, was already typeset and ready to go when it was killed withouty explanation.

Spreading this shit like nutella because goddamn textbooks are so expensive.
not necessarily art related but as someone who couldn’t afford their textbooks this semester this is a godsend
REBLOGGING because after a little digging, I found my $200 textbook for free in PDF form.
friendly reminder that this exists since I know we’re all going back to college soon
For those who are gonna HAVE to purchase their book, here’s what I do: Ready? Once you have your classes chosen, find the title, author, and ISBN #s of all your books Go to slugbooksDOTcom and search them up through there.
That site pretty much gets the sale and rent prices from a bunch of different sites (ex. Amazon, B&N, abesbooks) and shows them all together so you can find what’s your cheapest option.
Through this, I was able to rent a book for $30 instead of buying from campus for $220 Time: 23 hours ago at 3:05 pm Date: July 22nd, 2018"

 2 Attachment(s) I have my side mirrors adjusted correctly (away from car), but decided to install blind spot mirrors to better gauge the wheel to curb distance when parallel parking and also for a wider view in the rearward blind spot areas. I really like them - these work really well. This is the one I got and pic below shows where I mounted it. An integrated version should come from the factory. The cell phone picture didn't focus well on the mirror, but the 2"" mirrors are very clear in real life.
Here's a link to the ones I bought (pack of 4). I did not use the swivel mechanism: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0...?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Also noticed that there's a small shelf under the steering wheel. I have used Velcro to attach my garage door opener. It's completely out of sight and very convenient. I originally planned to buy the 2SS Homelink setup & harness, but decided to try this first."

Version 5.12, released in October 2017 is the last release for the 5.x branch and work has begun on Ardour 6 which is likely to enable a number of features already in the code, but currently deactivated in the git repository.
JACK Audio Connection Kit (or JACK ; a recursive acronym ) is a professional sound server daemon that provides real-time, low-latency connections for both audio and MIDI data between applications that implement its API . JACK has been developed by a community of open-source developers led by Paul Davis (who won an Open Source Award in 2004 for this work) and has been a key piece of infrastructure and the de facto standard for professional audio software on Linux since its inception in 2002. The server is free software , licensed under the GNU GPL , while the library is licensed under the more permissive GNU LGPL .
Paul Davis is a British software developer best known for his work on ( JACK ) audio software for the Linux operating system, and for his role as one of the first two programmers at Amazon.com .
He emigrated to the U.S. in 1989. He lived in Seattle for seven years, where he worked for the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Washington , and several smaller software companies in Seattle - and he and Shel Kaphan became the two programmers who helped start Amazon.com, but left soon after the company began.
He went on to fund the development of various audio software for GNU / Linux , including Ardour and the JACK Audio Connection Kit . He became one of the few people to work full-time on free software , and one of the few to do so without being an employee of a commercial entity.
Which this detailed information, I hope most of people would think how important is Paul Davis and how valuable is his work on Open Source/Free Software because he made possible that most of us can make digital music on Linux/FreeBSD/Mac/Windows. "

Don't blame just the Democrats, America. Every single Republican representative who didn't deal with this usurper demonstrated that they don't have the spine to abide by the Constitution and deal with people like Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah.
On Saturday, at a foreign speech at the opening of the Sauti Kuu Resource Centre a, “multi-million-shilling youth center built by his half-sister Auma Obama"" in Kogelo, Kenya Obama declared, “Now, three years ago, I visited Kenya as the first sitting American President to come from Kenya.""
“When I was president it was a little bit harder to get up here cause my plane didn’t fit the tarmac up here,"" he continued. “While three years ago my sister Auma introduced me before I gave a speech, today I’m really coming as a brother, as a citizen of the world, as someone with a connection to Africa to talk about the importance of what she’s doing but also to create a larger context for what’s possible.""
Take a look.
The claim took place at the 5:49 mark of the video above.
For all those who will chastise me and claim, ""Well, he meant that his father came from Kenya,"" I say, then he should have said that, but he didn't. We know what his grandmother has said. She claims to have been at his birth in Kenya.
We know what the Kenyan Parliament minutes contain, don't we?
As I wrote in 2015:
Go back and read the Kenyan Parliament's own minutes on November 5, 2008, where they openly stated, ""Mr. Obama , is a son of the soil of this country (Kenya). Every other country in this continent is celebrating the Obama win. It is only proper and fitting that the country which he originates should show the same excitement, pomp and colour.""
This statement was followed by the Deputy Speaker warning the member who just made the statement,
""You had better be very careful where you transgress between watching your own sovereignty and what can be interpreted in some quarters as some form of treason.""
You can go here and retrieve the November 5, 2008 document at the Kenyan Parliament website (or get the highlighted version on our site indicating important points provided by Lorri Anderson ), along with the one from March 25, 2010 (or get the highlighted version on our website indicating important sections provided by Lorri Anderson ).
The same month and year, Obama said he was the "" first Kenyan-American president .""
Then there is his fraudulent birth certificate . However, it's not just the fake birth certificate, which Obama's own attorney admitted was fraudulent , but even Barack and Michelle Obama, along with the Kenyan Ambassador Peter Ogego, have all said that Obama was either born in Kenya or referred to Kenya as ""his homeland."" Sheriff Joe Arpaio brought additional evidence and claimed this is a national security issue . Lord Monckton called Obama an illegal president after demonstrating the fraudulent nature of the birth certificate and even Israeli Science claims that Obama's birth certificate is a fake. Apparently so is Obama's selective service card and his social security number .
Meanwhile, if Congress would have cared rather than turned the other way, a lot could have been stopped. I consider representatives like Markwayne Mullins to be complicit in the high crimes, misdemeanors and treason of Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah because he simply didn't ""give a sh*t.""
And who is laughing now, America? Obama and all his minions are because they have taken America on a path to destruction and it seems he will never be brought to account, not even by this administration.

RENO, Nev. (AP) — An attention-grabbing pimp's campaign for the Nevada Legislature has sparked an anti-brothel effort that sex workers fear could spread to parts of the state that allow legal prostitution.
A November ballot referendum is seeking to shut down four brothels in Lyon County in eastern Nevada owned by Dennis Hof, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported this week.
Hof, the owner of half a dozen legal brothels in Nevada and star of the HBO adult reality series ""Cathouse,"" won a Republican primary for the state Legislature last month. Many leading Republicans in the state are shunning his candidacy and he has previously said the anti-brothel efforts are political retribution.
Most brothels operate in rural areas of Nevada. They're banned in the counties that contain Las Vegas and Reno. That includes the World Famous Mustang Ranch near Reno.
Proponents of the referendum say legal brothels open a door for human trafficking.
Women at the Mustang Ranch say closing legal brothels would actually mean more money for pimps and less safety for prostitutes.
Donny Gilman, son of Mustang Ranch owner Lance Gilman, wants initiative supporters to know that that their operation is a clean business.
All the women who work at the Mustang Ranch go through rigorous, annual FBI background checks, said Jennifer Barnes, a longtime madam at the brothel.
The Mustang Ranch says it employs more than 160 people on a $5.7 million payroll, including $4.3 million paid to workers called courtesans.
The brothel also donates about $150,000 every year to senior centers and food banks, while paying ""more taxes and fees per square foot than any other business in Nevada,"" staff said.
The supporters of the initiative also have suggested that legalized prostitution harms regional economic development.
Lance Gilman, who is a Storey County commissioner and co-manages the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, laughed at this idea.
""I would tell them to look just to the east of us and tell us that this brothel has had any impact on the economic growth of northern Nevada,"" he said, pointing toward the industrial center where Tesla, Amazon and Google facilities are.

Product features via manufacturer Provides music playback from various online streaming services such as Spotify and Amazon Music as well as from mobile devices using a Bluetooth connection. The black speaker can also connect to external speakers via Bluetooth if you want more punch than it can provide by itself. Even on its own, though, the Echo's 2.5 inch speaker and independent tweeter speaker provide clear, sharp, omnidirectional sound. If you have more than one Echo, you can also sync them up to play the same audio in different rooms of your house. The main feature of the Echo, though, is Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant. Alexa responds to voice commands and will play and pause music, adjust the volume, and play tracks by specific artists when told to. She can also search the Internet to find you the latest weather reports and news headlines. Her features aren't limited to media playback and weather updates, either. The Echo can be linked to compatible apps and smart home devices. Depending on how you set up your Echo with partnered apps, Alexa can adjust the heating in your home, turn your lights on and off, call you a cab, and even make phone calls. do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 6638559811"

Giovanni by Natasha Knight
My rating: 5 of 5 stars
Powerful - Unforgiving
Giovanni
""Don't Roll Over. Don't F *cking give up! You Fight. You get
F *cking mad. ""
Giovanni is definitely a force unto himself - he has no concept of personal space and impediments? He has no idea what that is. He also has a real problem with the word no. I have to admit when it came to his character we were definitely in a love-hate relationship - still are. I get why he Continue ...
Feral King by Sparrow Beckett
My rating: 5 of 5 stars
Feral King 👑
Holy chit - it is not often I give five stars - a book has to truly engage my ever emotion, make me forget I am here
Feral King 👑 did that and so much more
I think it was the reversal of roles that truly brought me into this story and held me captive -I honestly can not remember the last time I read a love story where the author approached the D/s relationship with such innocence of emotion from the D's point of view (yes I am trying Continue...

My rating: 5 of 5 stars
♡ Another deliciously dark and disturbing journey into the Omegaverse
Welcome to Wren's world -
Please fasten your seatbelts and keep your mind in the spillway at all times
Remember - THIS IS FANTASY
Please enjoy the ride - we will see you on the other side 😈
So where to start - I really abhor spoilers
Wren - she had my heartstrings Continue...
The Price of Brimstone by Allie Gail
My rating: 4 of 5 stars
🎠 WOW - A definite must read - One twisted turn after another!
""Nightmares are only dreams that have grown bored of the monotony""
This read was literally an amusement park of misdirection - carnal desires and OMG moments
I am going to try and do this without spoilers and repeats of the blurb- because truly the smallest detail will ruin the overall ""WTH"" effect that this book constantly provides its reader. ↪ Loc - He is one of the bad guys- but ohh Continue...
Perfect Vision by L.M. Halloran
My rating: 4 of 5 stars
Thrilling - Scandalous - Intense
A definite must read!
""I remember the other moments, too.""
""Memory-beads like stars strung together on my timeline, almost identical, yet each singular in intensity""
The story begins covering flashes of both ""then"" and "" now"" - the flow between the two points is done smoothly and is easy to follow - though, it left me a bit apprehensive because we get glimpses of the now that could indite any number of the stories lead characters - and Continue...
The Devil's Plaything by Claire Marta
My rating: 5 of 5 stars
""Holy Chit, our Puddin' is back""
""Hormonal and armed""
I think that sums it up 😉
If you have not read book one - STOP- go back and read it! Trust me 😈
In book one I mentioned that no one seemed trustworthy, it was quite possible that friends were the enemy and that our enemy was our friend (yeah I was there, the writing is that good) turns out I may have been right. Continue...

NEWS – You probably have a smoke detector in your home, right? How about a carbon monoxide (CO) detector? Do you have an Amazon Echo in your home too? That’s three individual devices that all take up space and need to be plugged in or charged. The Onelink from First Alert combines a smoke detector, a carbon monoxide detector, and a speaker with built-in Amazon Alexa all in one ceiling mounted hardwired module.
First Alert, the leader in home safety, recently launched the first of its kind Onelink Safe & Sound that you can use to keep your home safe from fire and the deadly odorless, colorless CO gas while also using it to listen to your favorite music and control your home with Alexa.
When you’re at home or away, the Onelink Safe & Sound will send push notifications of smoke and CO emergencies right to your phone. You can read more about the Onelink Safe & Sound on First Alert’s site or you can buy one from Amazon where it’s priced at $199.99.

I would not expect Amazon to resell phone numbers, but I've been surprised in the past about companies I thought were reputable doing it. It would be nice if somebody knows the definitive answer. Thanks again!"

Voice activated, they let you play music, create to-do lists, search the web, and control smart products, all hands-free. But can these virtual assistants help you manage your multi-cloud environment at work? Believe it or not, the answer is yes. The Alexa demo – a fun way to highlight an open architecture
Effectively managing your multi-cloud environment in today’s complex hybrid IT estate can be a Herculean task. But, according to a developer at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), it doesn’t have to be — just speak your request, wait a few seconds, and it’s taken care of. All you need is a multi-cloud management solution and a virtual assistant.
That same developer wanted to show the importance of an open architecture, so he enlisted Alexa, Amazon’s popular voice-based home assistant, to help him. Using open standards, open source software, and an open API, he showed that integrating one application with another can be relatively simple. In less than a week, he had the demo up and running — ready to entertain an audience at an upcoming conference. The importance of an open architecture
You may be wondering why the developer spent any time at all on this demo. Why is it so important that a multi-cloud management solution be extensible?
The answer is simple: it unlocks a world of possibilities that is only limited by your creativity. An open architecture lets anyone integrate one application to another, giving an enterprise unlimited opportunities to create custom experiences for themselves and their customers.
HPE recently announced HPE OneSphere , the industry’s first SaaS-based multi-cloud management solution for on-premises IT and public clouds. In this world of hybrid cloud, any multi-cloud management platform must be open and engineer friendly, and it must be able to easily integrate and work with other platforms. The extensible and open API
In the case of the Alexa demo, the voice service receives a command that interacts with the HPE OneSphere API. Alexa interprets the voice commands and then translates them into API calls to HPE’s multi-cloud management solution. The open API and extensive documentation in HPE OneSphere makes it simple for developers to integrate the solution with many other applications. And because the HPE software manages your entire hybrid IT estate through APIs, anyone can take advantage of the APIs to interact with their whole environment.
When the open source Alexa/HPE OneSphere demo becomes available on GitHub, it will allow developers to take it and build additional skills to interact with their own hybrid infrastructure. By writing additional interactions and queries, developers can easily use modern scripting languages to extend the skillset by utilizing the HPE OneSphere APIs and other software-defined infrastructure elements. This capability allows hybrid IT management to be fully customized to meet the specific needs of any organization. (To learn more about HPE open source innovation through collaboration and working with the HPE OneSphere API, check out the HPE Developer site .) Three uses cases for Alexa and HPE OneSphere
Although the original purpose of the HPE OneSphere/Alexa integration was to demonstrate how open the HPE OneSphere architecture is, the integration proved useful. The demo highlights how Alexa or similar virtual assistants can integrate with HPE OneSphere to help enterprises better manage their multi-cloud environments. I’ve included some examples below of how three different users (IT operators, developers, and executives) could benefit from this hands-free, multi-cloud management application.
HPE OneSphere gives IT managers a better view of their entire hybrid IT environment and includes automation and proactive management tools for increased productivity.
IT operator: Alexa, how are my cloud providers doing today?
Alexa: Welcome to HPE OneSphere. Two out of two providers’ status OK. Amazon Web Services scores 702. Private cloud scores 751.
IT operator : Alexa, what is the utilization of my private cloud?
Alexa: The utilization score of private cloud is 336, using 6% CPU, 63% memory, 30% storage.
HPE OneSphere lets developers use the tools and apps they need when they need them — without having to wait for IT to provision new infrastructure. Using the SaaS web portal or through APIs, developers have instant access to a pool of IT resources.
Developer: Alexa, create a project named Experiment in my production environment.
Alexa: Project Experiment created in your production environment at your facility per organizational policy.
Not only can IT operators and developers benefit from a multi-cloud management solution like HPE OneSphere, business executives can make better business decisions because of increased transparency. Real-time, cross-cloud insights enable CIOs and lines of business to increase resource utilization and reduce costs, improving efficiency across the board.
Executive: Alexa, what is my total spend for the month across all projects?
Alexa: Total spend across all of your providers for the month is $33,495. Not your father’s enterprise system
Today’s open architectures allow organizations to do amazing things. HPE open source API’s allows IT to manage clouds and infrastructure as code, so they can customize management of the entire hybrid IT environment in nearly unlimited ways – including receiving voice updates from a virtual assistant.
So what’s next? With the HPE OneSphere open architecture and API, you decide. Your creativity and imagination are the only limit.

(Photo: Josh Reynolds, AP)
Boston Dynamics is preparing to build its terrifying army of robot dogs, according to a Saturday report in Inverse that the company has set a target date of July 2019 as the time it will be ready to manufacture 1000 of its compact SpotMini models annually.
SpotMini is the smallest variant of Boston Dynamics' many different models of robo-dogs yet at approximately 84cm tall. It weighs ""around 30kg"" and has an hour and a half battery life, per TechCrunch and the company has recently demonstrated all kinds of functionalities like opening doors for other robots and increasingly complicated navigational skills .
While the company already announced plans to launch commercially in 2019 with a limited run of robots already in pre-production, Inverse's report has some new details, such as that the SpotMini is intended to eventually become a multi-use platform of sorts:
The overarching goal for the 26-year-old company is to become the what Android operating system is for phones: a versatile foundation for limitless applications. That's the plan, anyway.
.... Speaking last month at the CeBIT computer expo Hannover, Germany, [founder Marc Raibert] said Boston Dynamics is already testing SpotMini with potential clients in four categories: construction, delivery, security and home assistance.
... ""We've built ten by hand, we're building 100 with manufacturers at the end of this year and at the end of 2019, we're going to begin production at the rate of about 1000 a year"", he said of SpotMini, a prototype of which sat the stage at his feet.
The attachment point where the SpotMini's robotic arm stems from its body could in the future hold a variety of attachments ""to be designed and produced by third parties"", per Fortune , making it more versatile. For example, instead of a claw the arm could terminate in a power tool or a camera.
However, as Inverse noted, the company has endured criticism as a ""tech industry curio"" — particularly around the time Google put it on the open market in 2016 before its eventual sale to Softbank Robotics in 2017. That's included claims its numerous viral videos show teleoperation rather than machine learning, that the technology to make the robots useful simply isn't available yet , or that the odds are long of making them commercially cost-effective .
(In 2015, the US military declined to buy a prior model called the BigDog designed to carry ammunition or evacuate wounded troops, saying it was noisy enough to give away a unit's location .) SpotMini is likely to run in the tens of thousands of dollars at a minimum , limiting their availability.
One possible use for the robots is home delivery, where the robots would at least in theory face fewer regulatory hurdles than plans by Amazon and UPS to deliver packages by unmanned aerial vehicle.
But that approach creates its own problems, including that it would have to be cheaper than overworked humans , be capable of navigating obstacles that aren't static like pedestrians, dogs and traffic intersections and perhaps prepared for the possibility somebody could try to wrestle the package away from the robot.
Construction sites would perhaps be even harder to deploy a SpotMini in safely for human or bot, given that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ranks construction as one of the most dangerous industries .
Security seems like one of the more plausible uses for the SpotMini, given that all it really needs to do is walk around, record things and maybe detect and report anything weird going on. At a Softbank World presentation in Tokyo in 2017, Raibert showed off a model equipped with a camera. Photo: Shizuo Kambayashi, AP
Inverse also theorised that the SpotMini or its possible successors could find use in elder care, which tends to be so expensive that robots could be cost-effective:
In Japan, the elderly are preparing for robots to care for them and face a predicted ""shortfall of 370,000 caregivers by 2025"", reports The Guardian .
Because Spot Mini is just under three feet tall, it's objectively less-scary and might even appear cute if it were to take care of your ageing grandmother — fetching drinks and medicine and opening doors for her.
However, the Japanese robots in question tend to be simpler assistive devices like machines that help lift the elderly out of bed or smart mobility aids that automatically detect and compensate for inclines. And while SpotMini might look cute fetching food or medicines, it had better not pick the wrong ones and be capable of doing so even if a random thing falls over in front of a door.
In any case, Boston Dynamics' robot army may start rolling off production lines soon, whether or not it has anything more useful to do than serve as status symbols for the ultra-wealthy , navigate hallways, or maybe do backflips like its ATLAS cousin.
Gizmodo has reached out to Boston Dynamics for comment and we'll update this story if we hear back."

Oh how I wish I journaled, but I don't. I've tried many times but it never seems to work for me. Linda at Linda's Life Journal is what I call a super journalist. Her blog is a journal but she also keeps a paper journal and has for years. What a treasure she will be leaving her children.
Remember the ringed organizers that we bought refills for according to our needs? Now I was the queen of those. My daughter has always teased me that when I'm old and in a home she will come by every morning, remove the pages from my organizer, and throw them in the air. Then she'll scoop them up and leave me happy as can be with the task before me to organize again all those pages. That would probably work for me because I did love playing with organizers.
With my simple life these days a list and a calendar gets the job done. My calendar is almost empty. Do you use an academic calendar? I much prefer those to the regular calendars. Perhaps because I used one for seventeen years working in the academic world. Before Bob died my calendar was full, and poof, all that went away.
Since I tend to be scattered, and have the attention span of a flea in a hot skillet, I do better with some structure, and a list is just the thing. It isn't I don't know what I need to be doing, the tasks just seem to whirl in my head without a list to organize them.
To be honest, my list is never very long, and probably takes no more than an hour or so to complete, but I feel better with a list. Last week I timed how long it took me to run the vacuum, ten minutes. Yes I pad the list with things like 'make bed.'
Recently every day was Sunday when I opened my eyes in the morning. It finally came to me that I kept up with the days of the week by Bob's medical appointments. Without them I was lost. I fixed that. At the top of my list now I write the day of the week.
Are any of these things a part of your daily life?
There were spots on my carpet that really bothered me. Bob was hard on carpet. Remember he poured bleach in places trying to remove spots! Those places are there to stay. I just try to view them as love notes from Bob. I can't do that with spots of dirt. Neither can I get on my hands and knees anymore, nor scrub with the arm where I've had shoulder therapy.
I thought if I had a long handled scrub brush I'd be set. I found this Woolite set on Amazon and ordered it. I don't care about anything but the brush but it seems to work well. I don't want to do a full rug shampoo because I'm undecided how long I'm going to stay here. This seems to do the trick for spots. When I see a new spot or an old sport returning it will be quick and easy to give it another squirt and brush. "

I prefer my books made of dead trees, and my Kindle app satisfies when I just gotta have it right now, so this really doesn’t impact me much.
I guess I don’t understand complaints about the library delaying anything, though. In fact, I’m surprised that new release print editions are available the day of. I thought that whole “even writers gotta eat” thing would have delayed libraries getting their copies a bit just to pump sales figures, and I’m perfectly OK with that. Writers that don’t make money writing may find something else to do that does not involve telling me entertaining stories, so I’m pretty happy to pay for books and keep those people fed.
I love my library. I just never considered it an avenue for getting new releases for no money. July 22, 2018 at 10:52 pm
As an avid reader and library user, both physical and digital, I will fess up to an occasion where an exciting new book had a long waiting list and I did, in fact, purchase the ebook from Amazon out of eagerness / impatience.
That book was ‘Space Opera’ by Catherynne M Valente, which I first learned about on this site, and I loved it so much I bought a physical copy just to lend to friends. Since then I’ve read / listened to several more of her books from the library. I also purchased the entire Fairyland series on Kindle. And, the difference there was there again was there wasn’t a wait list for Six Gun Snow White and Radience, but the Fairyland books all involved waiting 2+ months to read.
All of which is to say, there is probably something to Tor’s data. While there are definitely readers who read library books exclusively for financial reasons (I mean, hey, that’s why the library is my first stop) and who prefer ebooks for reasons of disability (same here!) Tor is probably right that for hyped books, there are enough people whose plan B is “pony up and buy the ebook” rather than “wait patiently” or “read something else” when a book is unavailable at the library right away.
Now, there’s a ceiling to that: I probably wouldn’t buy more than, say, twenty books per year if I had zero library access; currently I buy maybe 12-15 in twelve months, and I check out easily over 100 from the library. There are absolutely authors who I first gave a shot to because their books were at the library and looked interesting, and I’ve since gone on to buy their other books. So overall I think libraries are good for authors. As is, you know, a generally literate society. But that doesn’t contradict the idea that short-term library release delays for new ebooks will probably result in more ebook purchases, given Tor’s expert data and my personal experience. JBieste says: July 22, 2018 at 11:10 pm
Nicely put John.
Hopefully people won’t blame libraries for the delay. Those who do have to realize that publishers and authors can’t survive without more people actually buying books, eBooks, audible books.
Wish you and Tor well in all ventures. You’re worth more than what you making. Hopefully you’ve decided this is your vocation and not something you’ll retire from once comfortable.
Looking forward to buying your books for many years.
P.S. Thank you for the acknowledgment awhile back that you were paying tribute to Iain Banks with some of your ships. You’re a class act. Techgrrl1972 says: July 22, 2018 at 11:45 pm
I’m at a place in my life where I can afford to buy a book and don’t use the library. Often, I have the hardcover, the audible version -and- the ebook. That said, I know damn well that I am an outlier with privilege that the vast majority of people simply don’t have.
My opinion is that Tor will discover no or a negative impact on their ebook sales.
If they REALLY wanted to help their not-John-Scalzi authors AND bump up sales, they should institute a Free Library like Baen has. Pretty sure (Check Eric Flint’s analysis) that it has been proven that the existence of the Free Library has resulted in MORE sales, especially for the b-list authors, who suddenly see sales of their backlist go up.
Go even further and make their backlist available to the Public Libraries for a nominal 1 dollar per book. That might take the sting out of this latest policy. tom mears says: July 22, 2018 at 11:52 pm
I grew up as a library reader. I don’t think I was really aware of bookstores until I went to college (campus bookstore). All through college I was too poor to afford hardbacks, and ebooks were still 20+ years in the future. So it was paperbacks or the library for me. I can’t say that waiting was a great hardship.
It wasn’t until I became relatively affluent that I started buying hardbacks. Ebooks were still 10+ years in the future, so again waiting still wasn’t a burden.
Now there is this thing called Amazon.com was a thing (maybe you’ve heard of them, they are quite popular I understand). I am finally too jaded to deal with libraries. Waiting is finally a burden.
I usually drop the bucks on the ebook the week it comes out. If it is really good I will also try to get the print hardback. Mainly now I only get dead-tree books because I actually like the look of a library all of my own. I then haul these to Nebula/Hugo weekends to get Scalzi (or whoever) to deface the book by scrawling their name in it. freestyletacet says: July 23, 2018 at 1:41 am
I don’t know how this’ll affect overall sales, but they’ll definitely lose sales to libraries.
I am someone who checks out a fair amount of library ebooks through the New York and Brooklyn Public Libraries, and a big part of the process is recommending books for the library to purchase through OverDrive. The number of recommendations affects the number of copies the library purchases, and they’ll almost certainly get more recommendations for new releases than for a book that’s four months old, simply because most of us will have forgotten.
Example: when Naomi Novak’s Spinning Silver came out (published by Del Rey), I went to OverDrive, discovered the book hadn’t been purchased yet, and recommended it. Now the NYPL has 17 copies, because a lot of people put in recommendations.
Conversely, I went looking for Mary Robinette Kowal’s The Calculating Stars (published by Tor) and not only does the library not own it, it’s not even in the system, so I can’t recommend it. Will my fellow readers and I remember to come back in four months? Will they get the same number of recommendations in four months as they would have today? Will they buy as many copies in four months as they would have this month?
Guess I have an email to write. Michael says: July 23, 2018 at 6:54 am

“For the record, I’m still waiting to read Head On as an ebook from my local library, because the waiting list is very long. Not getting something right away is the price I pay for expecting it to be both free and convenient. Having an extra time cost from the publisher is annoying, but Tor knows that, and they’re hoping that it will sometimes be annoying enough that I’ll give them more money instead.”
This is interesting, because it shows that the impact of this policy will vary by author. In the big picture, the number of e-books available is small compared to the number of people who want to read the new novel by any high profile author. For a lower profile auther that may not be the case.
I don’t know what conclusion to draw from that. If it helps sales for lower profile authors it seems like a good thing. Ideally, I think publishers would not do this as a blanket policy and instead would give authers some say in when their e-books are available from libraries. But maybe that would have its own problems. Greg says:
So, they are gonna release new works to theaters for 4 months, and only after that will folks be able to watch them for free on cable?

I think a lot of people forget libraries actually are book buyers too. There are almost 120,000 libraries in the US. Even if we assume only a fraction of those offer ebooks, that’s still quite a few books. Plus, for bigger name authors libraries will buy multiple copies. AND libraries already pay for the books multiple times–they don’t pay the price a consumer does for an ebook. The price is higher and then they only get a limited number of check outs before they have to repurchase. (Ebooks are not a great deal for libraries!) I suspect the comment above about how this will drive down sales TO libraries is on target. I’m open to seeing what Tor’s data shows. Perhaps they really will generate enough sales from individuals to offset the fewer copies libraries will buy. I definitely don’t think it’s an open and shut case though.

I wait almost that long for hard copy books from the library, so I don’t mind waiting four months for an eBook. I’m just grateful to get electronic library books. I lug so much stuff to work and books weigh my bag down even more, and it’s great to read on the commute. raldawen says: July 23, 2018 at 9:01 am
Not surprising. MacMillan was already trying to price itself out of the library eBook market long before this decision. I can tell you as a public librarian responsible for selecting both print and electronic media that MacMillan’s leasing policies have been regressing for years. Right now I can order a hard copy of Redshirts from Ingram for $24.99 (plus a discount) or I can buy it on Overdrive for $40 (no discount) and have it expire in 52 checkouts or 2 years, whichever happen(ed) first. We bought 5 copies in hardback, all still in the system. Our copies of Redshirts expired. Since the first 6 months are where the bulk of circulations occur MacMillan is basically telling us to stop buying their product. We had already mostly obliged due to their absurd leases so /shrug. Seems like they would have figured out they are actively contributing to KU sucking all the oxygen out of the room but its all about those short term profits nowadays.

Man, if we ever needed a motto/slogan to go viral in this day and age, I think “Practice empathy, please.” would be the one. As for the topic at hand, I don’t know enough about the ins and outs of ebook lending to offer an opinion on that, but tangentially, I am of the firm opinion that libraries are a net good for society and should be cherished. July 23, 2018 at 10:09 am
I’m curious as to Tor’s current eBook pricing strategy for libraries. Are they one of the publishers that charges the library 3-5 times what a private individual pays? If anything, I suspect they might find that they are selling fewer eBooks to libraries with this new pilot. OhLibn says:
Thanks for the direct email to Tor/MacMillan, John.
Two comments I will be making to them as the person responsible for purchasing digital formats:
It costs us $60.00 to license Head On (just as an example) in ebook format through OverDrive, for the earliest of 52 checkouts or 2 years. Then we have to buy it again if we want to keep it available to our readers. On Amazon.com it’s $25.99, currently reduced to $13.99, for unlimited reads by a single consumer.
Also, by the time that 4 months rolls around, I won’t have Head On or any other previously released title in focus and therefore it won’t ever be licensed by us unless someone actively requests it, and I’m pretty sure that most of them will have forgotten it, too.
It will be interesting to see how this all plays out. Pianoman says: July 23, 2018 at 11:10 am
Who is lucky enough to live in an area where their public library is actually purchasing not-so-popular sci-fi books in e-book format? Must be nice! That certainly is not the case for my library system, and I live in a major metro area with (I think) a very good library system. My library system is likely to have e-books from authors like John Scalzi and Connie Willis, but any e-books from a sci-fi author less popular than that is not going to be carried. So making those books available to the library four months later isn’t going to matter, when they aren’t going to buy those e-books anyway. Logophage says: July 23, 2018 at 11:33 am
I predict that Tor/Macmillan won’t see an uptick in e-book sales, and will eventually backtrack on this experiment. But I don’t blame them for trying it! Sure, as an avid library user and librarian, I’d love it if everything were always available to everyone all the time for free in perpetuity, but the world doesn’t work that way. This is a (relatively) new aspect of the Book Biz, and there’s not a lot of data out there–so why shouldn’t Tor/Macmillan go ahead and generate some data? If it costs them (in sales, or more likely in good will) they’ll figure it out soon enough and right the course. If it benefits them (more likely in sales this time), they’ll figure that out too. Publishers gotta eat. Logophage says: July 23, 2018 at 11:40 am
(Wishing I could edit my previous tweet now) @Pianoman, this is a situation where smaller library systems in less major-metro areas may have the advantage over yours, because they enter into consortia with their peers. I currently tap into the e-audiobook collections of two statewide library consortia (my home state and that of my parents) and there’s very little I can’t get hold of. Although sometimes the hold list is ridiculous…I’m currently 74th in line (up from 113th) for one title with a 6-plus month wait. July 23, 2018 at 11:48 am
@nonny asks above:
This also raises a question – why single out ebooks? If you think you’re losing sales to libraries, shouldn’t you also window physical books?
There’s a thing in US copyright law called the “right of first sale”: if I purchase a book, the copyright owner can restrict my right to copy the book, but they can’t claim any control over the physical book itself. So I am free to resell the book at a discount, share it with all my friends, give it to my local library, and so on, even though the publisher may wish that all these other people had to pay full price for their own copies.
(In some other countries, including the UK and Canada, libraries pay additional fees to publishers to compensate them for their lost revenue.)
Electronic books, for better or worse, don’t have this legal status. July 23, 2018 at 12:14 pm
I don’t think it’s unreasonable; at the same time, I think there’s a good case to be made that four months is too long or that there will be unexpected consequences.
I have found that in the Toronto library system for new releases it’s almost always quicker to get the hardcover than it is to get the ebook (unless you manage to jump on it early). hyrosen says: July 23, 2018 at 12:29 pm
NYPL now has The Calculating Stars. They still aren’t showing Red Waters Rising. I recommended both for purchase, as physical books. Anyone can do that here: https://www.nypl.org/collections/nypl-recommendations/recommend-book
As to windowing paper books, that might be possible if publishers have special library editions (with tougher bindings and covers, say), but in general, the first sale doctrine means that anyone can buy a book and then lend it out regardless of what the author or publisher might wish. And thank goodness for that. TheMadLibrarian says: July 23, 2018 at 1:15 pm
Anything that prevents my library from initially buying an e-book will pretty much keep us from ever buying that e-book, unless it turns out to be a sleeper title that gets hot 6-9 months down the road from a promotion on NPR or some such. Once the initial buzz dies down and demand falls, we won’t buy an e-book without significant prodding unless the price point is very attractive. We’ll simply buy more e-books from publishers that don’t make it hard to buy their product. I will wait to see what TOR/Macmillan discovers from this strategy, and hope they are wise enough to reconsider if it turns out they’ve shot themselves in the foot.

OK, a warning that this is going to ramble a bit but the topic hits close to home for a number of reasons as I work in the technology industry and my spouse is a librarian.
The key to this policy to me seems to come down to whether or not books are a commodity. Many of the comments have treated them as such. I’m not sure that is correct. A book by John Scalzi is not the same as a book by Stephen King is not the same as a book by H.G. Wells. I applaud Tor for experimenting in this area but digital publishing is still taking baby steps.
When the only way to get a book was as a physical object printed on a Gutenberg press costing an average of a year’s wages for a working person it is not surprising that (a) few were printed and (b) only the “mega sellers” (e.g., the Bible, Stephen King) were printed. We’ve since graduated to cheaper and cheaper modes of publishing until the cost of a new copy is effectively zero for a digital book. This actually gives consumers unparalleled choice in how to acquire a copy of a book they want to read compared to even 10 years ago. But it also makes it difficult to determine how to reward the efforts of the authors properly.
This policy step by Tor may make it difficult and/or annoying to people that want to read the latest King or Scalzi ‘hot off the presses’ but I am old enough to recall when that new work would only be available in hardcover form for many months at a 2014 adjusted cost of $100 (Bureau of Labor Statistics shows a general increase in consumer prices from 1970 to 2014 of over 500%; hardcovers back then for the major releases tended to cost $20-$30 eac); then in trade or quality paperback for about $50.00 (adjusted, based on $10 cost in 1970), and finally perhaps a cheap edition at maybe $15.00 (adjusted, based on $3). Now you can get that work as an ebook for $10-$15 right away, making it financially accessible to a much wider audience from day one.
As for borrowing, for popular works libraries used a service that rented multiple copies of bestsellers that the library would return when demand decreased to be re-sold, opening the shelves to the next bestseller. The library could meet the demand of the public without ruining the budget or ending up with large numbers of copies that never left the shelves. Unfortunately non-bestsellers got short shrift, in many cases never making it to the library. This compromised one of the core missions of a public library: making a wide range of works available to the taxpaying public. At least now ebooks allow libraries to accession a far greater range for the same cost as before.
My guess is that this policy will result in a modest increase in sales of bestselling authors but will not affect midlist or specialty authors’ works much. Those midlist ebooks (and their authors and publishers) may actually benefit from immediate release for library lending. People are less likely to wait 4 months to try a new author they’ve heard about. (Example: on the JoCo cruise a couple of years ago I heard Mary Robinette Kowal discuss her work. I had never read anything by her before so I promptly purchased a couple of ebooks and now read her religiously. I probably would not have done that if I had to wait 4 months, losing the author and publisher a revenue stream.)
What I would really like to see is a system that allows you to try a book for a limited time at a very low cost. I realize Amazon is experimenting with this, but so far it is unsatisfying. I read several hundred books a year, and am always hungry to try new authors, but will rarely spring for a couple of books by an unknown without some incentive (see Kowal example). Again, this requires de-commoditizing books and treating each author based on multiple factors. This probably cannot be done with a ‘one size fits all’ policy like Tor’s proposal. Maybe past sales and relative familiarity with the reading public can be used to come up with a sliding price and release policy. Stephen King’s next book has a 4 month delay, John Scalzi’s a 2 month delay, and a promising new author is available immediately for lending and also a one-time, short-term copy can be purchased for $0.79.
To sum up, John put it best by saying “Read widely! Try new stuff!” Any policy needs to fit both the financial requirements of the publisher and the desire to introduce the reading public to as many books as possible and induce them to try them. Kate says:
Thank you for addressing this on Whatever. I appreciate your take on this. Claas says: July 23, 2018 at 5:23 pm
Times are changing, chnaging times require change. Tor is trying, let’s giv ethem the benefit of douvt and see how it pans out.
Meanwhile, I migrated almost exclusively tp ebooks. I followed your advice and discovered fantastic e-comics with a new publishing house called Arlhaven. They really bring a new approach to ebooks, at least in regard to pricing and passing the “digital” cost savings to consumers.
Hope Tor follows their path. Roberta says: July 23, 2018 at 8:26 pm
I appreciate your thoughtful response, John, I really do. This reminds me of buying videos for the library many years ago, when the studios told us we could get a title right away for $100 (in the 80s!) or wait a month and pay half that. E-books are still so expensive or limited (see 28 loan limits, above) that we can only buy one e-book for every three paper copies we otherwise purchase. And we can’t ILL/borrow e-books from other libraries the way we can with print books, even in a consortium, so it’s like we have to own everything ourselves. Libraries are about SHARING, people! :-)
I also think that most library users will have no idea about Tor’s strictures and will assume that their library doesn’t purchase or highly value science fiction in their e-collections. They will buy Tor books online if they can afford to, or read the paper copy. So yes, I think it might improve sales, and Tor is a business after all. It just kind of screws libraries and their users. cjozzz says:
The library where I work is unlikely to buy “old” ebooks. Joy says: July 24, 2018 at 10:30 am
Based on my own ebook purchasing behavior, I don’t think this is going to affect a whole lot. Most of the books I check out from the library are not typically the “I need to buy it when it’s first released because I love this author/series so much” books (unless I have cash flow difficulties). I look at the library’s new acquisitions periodically, notice when a book looks interesting, and put myself on the hold list to wait–I assume a fair amount of waiting built in with library ebook lending unless the book is backlist. I will also wait for price drops on books that look interesting but where I’m not already invested in the author/series. But I too am interested in the data Tor discovers from this. Beth says: July 24, 2018 at 12:03 pm
This decision would be less upsetting to me if Tor had chosen to withhold its new publications in ALL formats. The decision to ban libraries from purchasing its e-books, and ONLY its e-books, on the day of release feels a little discriminatory. What about library patrons who need large print, or dyslexic-friendly fonts? Or those who can’t carry home a big, unwieldy stack of dead-tree books from the library, or hold one open with two good hands? E-books are an absolute godsend for certain readers, and denying them the chance to borrow a new book at the same time as all other library patrons just seems wrong to me."

‘The retailer, which last year made more than £6bn of revenues in Britain, has a disciplinary system under which points are accrued for illness. Workers are issued a penalty point for each episode of sickness.
Workers are told that more than one point will result in a “series of counselling and disciplinary meetings” and between four and six points can result in dismissal.
In one case, a woman who spent three days in hospital with a kidney infection was docked two points, reduced to one on appeal, despite providing a hospital note.
The system has been revealed in an investigation by The Sunday Times at Amazon’s sorting depot in Dunfermline, Scotland.
The undercover reporter was paid £7.35 per hour by an agency that supplies workers to Amazon, but was left with less than the minimum wage after paying £10 for the agency’s bus which took her to the site 40 miles from her home in Glasgow.
It emerged this weekend that some low-paid workers are camping out in woodland near the sorting depot to avoid paying the bus costs and ensure they are left with more than the minimum wage…
The reporter obtained a job with PMP Recruitment, one of the two main agencies that hires and supervises workers at the Dunfermline depot. The investigation found: Workers being threatened with dismissal if they accrued too many points for illness, late attendance or absence, or for making too many errors or failing to hit productivity targets. A claim from a worker in Amazon’s on-site first-aid clinic that workers were under pressure to hit targets and were suffering injuries in the rush to collect products Workers were expected to cover more than 10 miles a day in the warehouse collecting items, but water dispensers to ensure they avoided dehydration were regularly empty The reporter was told she had to sign an opt-out of the working time directive, which limits weekly hours to 48, in order to get a job.
The reporter was employed as a “temporary warehouse operative” at Amazon’s vast plant in Fife. She worked in the “picking” department, which involved retrieving items from across several floors of the sprawling warehouse, according to orders displayed on a handheld scanner she was given. She worked at least 10 hours a day, with an unpaid 30-minute lunch break and two 15-minute paid breaks….
Under the system set out in the Amazon temporary associate handbook, half a point is issued to recruits who are late to work or late back from a break; one point for “one period of sickness”; and three points for “no call, no show”. The undercover reporter was told that anyone who was more than 30 seconds late in arriving at work or returning after a break would be subject to the half-point penalty.
Workers were also told that if they made more than one error a week in collecting items or failed to hit productivity targets they could be subject to a disciplinary process, which could result in dismissal.’"

We have owned it for three years having purchased it from the original family, it's been a lot of fun and gets lots of compliments at campgrounds. There are two full size beds in the bunk ends and there are two dinettes which will convert into two additional beds. You can move one of the tables outside for additional floor space or outdoor dining. The canvas is original and in very good condition for being 47 years old. All the screens are perfect, zippers all work. It also has the clear vinyl curtain on the large window that will allow for light while keeping out rain or wind. The exterior of the trailer is in great shape. The dinette cushions are the original foam which we recovered. We replaced the bunk end foam which was worn out with memory foam. There is a three burner gas stove which I don't think has been used much, it looks pristine. We always cooked outside on our Coleman stove or grill. There is also an orange enamel sink in like new condition. The flooring is the original vinyl in good condition. There is a water tank under one of the dinette benches, the faucet is a pump style. The faucet pump is currently not working, you can get a replacement on Amazon or trailer supply places for about $40. We removed the original furnace which was not functioning which gave us another cabinet for storage. This unit does not have a fridge but we will include a cool vintage Coleman pop up cooler. There are two new tires (purchased last summer) and it has two spares which are old. We upgraded the interior light to an LED fixture and added an exterior LED light. We also replaced the roof vent cover as the old one was dark green and cracked. The quilts and pillows on the bunk end beds are not included, nor the battery. The other décor items come with as well as a trailer cover for storage. We really enjoyed this little pop up, it's light (just under 1400 lbs), easy to tow and simple to use. It's great if you want to upgrade from a tent but still have something simple and light to tow with some vintage flair.

While it isn't is rich and colorful as Silicon Valley, there is quite a story to be told. I believe it all started with IBM's arrival but you can make an argument that the momentum really picked up in the mid to late 80's. A prominent figure of that movement and a true legend in this town, Ed Taylor, recently passed away and when I heard the news, even though I wasn't part of his inner circle, it hit me hard.
For this post, please excuse my lack of specific details but from what I believe, Ed Taylor moved to Austin the mid 80's, possibly 1986. There was some contract/consulting business that his company, Pencom Systems, had been doing with IBM that warranted a physical office in Austin and Ed was part of the original team that relocated here from New York City.
Ed was an amazing individual. He was a true leader and had charisma that comes with being a leader. It was all born in him. I remember seeing a picture of him at his house where he was a young kid, possibly 4-5 years old, on the beach and his chin was resting on his hand, elbow in the sand and his look screamed out at you, ""Yep, I'm going to be very successful and powerful. Unbelievable confidence and naturally, his communication skills were incredible. At the very core, he was a great salesman. He had visions and he sold brilliant people on his visions to help build the many companies that he ran.
When I first met Ed Taylor - I was a technical recruiter at Pencom and it was my first professional job out of graduate school. I started there in July of 1995 and the position required six months in their New York office. Pencom's strategy was to have all of their new employees be taught in the classroom and in the bullpen by their senior/experienced recruiters. The company wanted us to get the different angles and approaches to the profession of recruiting so that we had this very well rounded understanding of what it took to be successful. And of course, all of this paralleled with life as well. Being successful in recruiting, in Pencom's eyes, was the same as being successful in life and I agreed with this 100%.
The first person to teach us and spend time with us was Ed Taylor. He spent the first week with us and as expected, he got down to the nuts and bolts of properly communicating opportunities to software engineers, how to qualify candidates and the critical importance of building your own professional network. It was mostly Business/Recruiting 101 with a lot of life lessons involved. However, a byproduct of the time spent with us was to share his passion and his energy for Pencom and the opportunity in front of us. Along with Wade Saadi, the Founder of Pencom, there was no one more committed and personally invested in Pencom than Ed. And to kick off our 6 month period in their Headquarters, it was 100% clear who you started this process with. You started with Ed. In addition to the recruiting fundamentals, Ed shared many of his life stories and the history of Pencom and the success of the company. His final words to us were very clear,
Give this opportunity everything you have, put your trust in us and we'll take care of you. This is a family and you are part of this family.
I am not sure how the last hour went but I remember all 20+ rookies (as new Pencom employees were called) giving him a standing ovation. I think my hands were in the air and I was shouting. Ed started to walk out of the door and Wade came in at the time. The two of them hugged and then kissed each other on the cheeks. I remember saying to myself, ""Dang, they must be good friends"". And you could see at that moment, that Ed and Wade had a deep, deep friendship that had be well intact for decades by then.
Moving to Austin/Getting to Know Ed - In December of 1995, I moved to Austin and worked in Pencom's contingency technical recruiting arm. They had a couple of businesses that were in Consulting Services. Pencom Software (PSW), Pencom Systems Administration (PSA and later called Collective Technologies) and later, a firm called Pencom Web Works. Ed was primarily in charge of PSA, a division that consisted of a highly qualified Unix and Windows Systems Administrators that were responsible for delivering project based, managed consulting services to clients located in Austin and beyond. This was Ed's baby. He was the Founder of this company and he ran that from the top down. However, we still saw him around the office on a daily basis and he was always there to share his insight and experience with us. And yes, when we had months where the production was low, he would bark at us and tell us to get our act together. It wasn't anything negative or demeaning and more than anything, he simply wanted to light a fire under our asses and get us focused.
Pencom's strategy of hiring rookies was a unique one and at the executive ranks, I have to think their strategy was to wait and see which recruiters were going to stick around and which ones would quit. Through most of 1996, I just plugged away and despite having a steep learning curve and being quite emotionally immature, I began to experience some success in recruiting and like all successful recruiters and salespeople, Pencom took notice and I seemed to be more in touch with some of the executives there. This included Ed. I found myself catching up with him over sports or just daily business and by late '96/early '97, Ed and I talked about the fact that both of us liked to play racquetball. Ed said that he was ""pretty good"" and invited me to play with him sometime. We finally got together and it was the weekend of The Masters, the year Tiger won his first major. It was a Sunday and I met Ed at The Hills, a fitness/country club. Ed was waiting for me as I got there.
My main concern was that I was 27 years old and, in the recreational sense, a very good racquetball player and could still run a 40 meter dash sub 5 seconds. I was about to play a man in his late 40's who smoked cigarettes on a regular basis and since he was an executive at the company I worked at, I was worried about beating him so badly that it could possibly hurt my career advancement at Pencom. I was doing well as a recruiter and I didn't want to do something stupid in my off hours with the co-founder of the company. We warmed up a bit and Ed could hit a nice shot and you could tell that his form and techniques were good. However, I was still worried about this. After warming up, Ed said that I could serve to start the game.
In racquetball, it's mostly proper form to send a soft serve deep in the corners and allow the other player to return the shot. I didn't do that. My main strategy in racquetball was to do a hard serve into one of the corners and attempt to immediately put the other player on his heels. And I did this with Ed. I'll never forget it. I dropped the ball for its one bounce, leaned back and crushed the ball as hard as I could into one of the corners and Ed returned a blistering backhand that hit the wall was about 6 inches above the floor. The ball hit the wall and dribbled back to me without any remote chance whatsoever of returning his shot. I picked up the ball, wide eyed and gave it to Ed. He was looking right at me, saying to himself, ""I'm about to beat the living shit out of you in this game"".
And it was incredible. I remember running all along the backline trying to return his shots and I couldn't. He was barely moving around at all. I was gasping for breath towards the end of the game and I remember the score stood at 18-4. We were going to 21. I was thinking to myself, ""Well, is he going to call this off or perhaps, at least start to go easy on me?"". In fact, he didn't, he turned it up even more and for the first time in the game, he started to move a little bit and really make sure each shot was a kill shot.
And that was the very first life lesson I learned from Ed. Everyone, trust me, it's not cruel to say this. It is a reality of life. You respect your competition, you play fairly with your competition but in the end, you CRUSH your competition. At this moment, I was this half dead roach crawling across the kitchen floor and Ed came up and just stomped me out. Ed had me at this weakened point and rather than have pity and turn the game in to this half ass back and forth sloppy game of racquetball, he put me out of my misery. Racquetball games are played in the format of ""Best 2 our of 3"" or Best 3 out of 5"". We wound up playing two games that afternoon and I went home with my tail between my legs. We continued to play throughout the year of 1997 and some of 1998 and I never beat him. I did a little better but I don't believe the score ever got above 21-10...
Coming back to the crush your competition part, remember this:
Google, Amazon, Facebook, Linkedin...They don't have competitors. Their founders were able to realize that critical, very hard to reach market position where they are without competitors and they did this by going into each and every day with the objective of crushing their competition. And Ed Taylor believed in this and he ran his companies with that mindset as well. If you are coming up in business, it is your job to be the absolute best software engineer, sales person, roofer, plumber, electrician and if at all possible, if you get the chance, you want to crush your competition. On that Sunday in March of 1997, I was Ed's competition and he crushed me thoroughly. It wasn't until about 14-15 years later that I realized this was such a good and special moment. Up until then, I always had the impression I just got my ass beat for no reason.
Spending time at Ed's house - Again, I don't know how the relationship progressed but eventually, I starting receiving invitations over to Ed's house for dinner and the holidays. His children were young back then and his wife, Liz, often had dinner cooked up or had visitors coming over. Looking back, I now realize that it was pretty easy to see that in the late 90's, I was just this isolated individual with no family around, no wife/girlfriend and Ed being Ed, looked after his family. And his family was Pencom. I have to think he thought over what I might have been doing over the Christmas holidays in 1997 and told Liz that he would have me over because he'd much rather have that than knowing one of his employees was just hanging out by himself.
So I would come over and play with the kids and talk with Liz. One time, they had a dinner gathering and Liz mentioned to me that Christopher Cross' son was going to be there. I was like, ""What??? You're kidding me!"" And sure enough, his son showed up and I just sat over there in awe. I think Ed was already getting sleepy by 9pm but I was just in a state of shock. I was around this very successful family, rubbing elbows with the Founder and they were treating me like ""family"". It really meant a lot to me.
One time, I asked Ed how much his house cost and he deflected that in a polite way while at the same time, subtly communicating that you don't ask those kind of questions to people. You don't pry into their financial lives. The only thing he ever told me about his financial position was that he never invested or traded in the stock market. He said it was gambling. I was involved in that at the time and what I thought was partaking in the dot.com craze at the time was really just gambling. His look at me made that very clear too.
Anyways, with these visits over the holidays to Ed's home, I realized another revelation:
He was a family man.
And that really blew me away because, for whatever reason, I grew up with the understanding that if you are 100% business and if your goal in life is to become rich, you put business and money ahead of everything. You win at all costs. And when I first met Ed at Pencom's rookie training, I thought he was like that too. But no way whatsoever. He was all about family. And yes, to be clear, it was prioritized too.
He loved his wife and kids more than anything. He loved Wade He loved Tommy Morgan - If he didn't love Tommy Morgan, he loved talking about Tommy Morgan. My apologies if I am failing to name others who are close to him but you know your relationship with him and know he loved you. You were part of his family.
And yes, he cared about me personally. I felt it. Again, I wasn't even part of his inner circle but I played racquetball with him and I was a regular at his house for the holidays. He genuinely cared about me and it's because I was an employee at his company and he truly believe that the Pencom family was indeed, his family.
One Unique Moment of Brilliance - I can go on forever about Ed and his knowledge of history, his knowledge of business, his brilliance but one particular moment I had with him really stands out and it was in the last 2 months of my time at Pencom.
This was in 1999 and after four years at Pencom, I was going to leave. I was a good recruiter there but again, I was very emotionally immature and it was clear that despite my productivity and my success as a recruiter, there wasn't much in the way of promotions at the company. I started to get a little angry at the company and from a professional standpoint, I realized that the next move for me was to simply leave the firm and start doing independent recruiting on my own. I loved to recruit and that's all I really could do and had not developed professionally in any other context so hey, let's just walk out the door and try it on my own.
By then, our offices were on Bee Caves Road, relocating from Great Hills Trail and the technical recruiting division I was in was downstairs from Ed's company, Collective Technologies. This is an incredible story. I have always had my regular routine and part of that routine meant leaving around 5:30pm every day to go play soccer or work out at the gym. When I exited the door, Ed was always there too. He was smoking a cigarette and talking with one of the Collective Technologies' consultants. For almost a year, I would walk out, catch eyes with Ed, exchange pleasantries and then walk to my car. Every single day it was like this.
By June of 1999, I was one month away from leaving and I started doing something on my own that would have been deemed unethical. Back then, there wasn't Linkedin or Facebook. You connected with software engineers over email or phone and I didn't have any database with me. I had all of my spirals of contacts I had saved through the years but what I needed was my database that was on Pencom's system. Every month, it was common practice to print out our database and keep that at our desk. I decided to start taking mine home with me. I was basically going to take the past couple of months so that I had a current database to reach out to.
The first day I planned to leave the office with the database sheets, as always, Ed was outside chatting with one of his consultants. I said to myself, ""Okay Mark, let's put the database sheets in your lunch box and then just cover it up with your arm as you walk out"". No big deal, right? I was a little nervous but I decided to go ahead and do it. What happened next was truly unbelievable and a testament to Ed's genius and just how well he knew everyone, especially me.
I start to open the door, like 300 times before, I have my lunch box strapped over my shoulder and I have my arm slightly bent back to cover the sheets and of course, I have this nervous look in my eyes. I look up to say good night to Ed. He looks at me, glances down at the lunch box and then looks back up to my eyes with no smile whatsoever. I feel him ask this question to me:
So, what are hiding in your lunchbox?
I stroll by and walk to my car, saying over and over again in my head, ""He busted me! He busted me!"". Nothing came of the moment but it was pure genius how I altered my manner ever so slightly and Ed noticed immediately. Quite simply, he was a genius with people. He knew them so well and so deeply. It was incredible.
Moving on from Pencom - It wasn't much. I went into my manager's office and told him I was resigning. Tom Morgan called me and we discussed some ways that I could possibly stay but in the end, I chose to stick with my decision.
In the past, Ed had had some heated conversations with people who had resigned from Pencom. He felt a sense of betrayal and he was angry about that. However, these employees were most often associated with his Collective Technologies company and their resignation affected the company a little more than mine did. I was cleaning out my desk, some people were coming over to say ""goodbye"" and I noticed Ed walking in from the corner of my eye. He walked past me, he didn't say anything but he gently put his left hand on my left shoulder and held it there for a little bit. He continued walking by and then took his hand off.
I never spoke with him or saw him again. There wasn't any bad blood but I am sure he was disappointed that I wasn't part of the Pencom family any more. However, I am not lying when I say that as the years went by, I was hoping that somehow our paths would cross, simply to share a warm hello to each other. But it never did. And owing to his brilliance again, he willed it that way. I wasn't part of his inner circle but I was a recruiter at Pencom and when I chose to leave his family, he said a warm ""goodbye"" in the form of his grabbing my shoulder and our paths never crossed again.
The past couple of weeks had me trying to look up pictures of him. I could not find his obituary. I was doing everything I could to find something about him. And then, finally, I did see a picture that told me everything about him. It was a family photo of his daughter's wedding. His daughter was talking back down the aisle after saying her vows. She and her now husband were coming towards the photographer and in the picture, you see Ed on the left, throwing some flowers in the air. He has this smile on his face that was just beaming. His look told you that it might have been the happiest day of his life. And for the millionth time, it told everyone what we have known for so very long.
He was all about family. He loved his family. The photo brought tears to my eyes and reminded me what an incredible man he was. God bless you, Ed and thank you for everything you taught me.

Subscriptions to online video services such as Netflix in the United Kingdom have surpassed those for traditional television for the first time. Or have they? Across all video viewing, which is around five hours a day on average, subscription video accounts for 18 minutes, rising to 30 minutes day for those aged 16-34, with a third of their viewing on devices other than a television set.
The numbers come from a new Media Nations report from Ofcom, the United Kingdom communications regulator.
It makes for great headlines but it is worth unpacking the numbers.
In the United Kingdom, subscriptions to the three most popular online streaming services, Netflix, Amazon Prime and NOW TV, reached 15.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, overtaking the number of television subscriptions at 15.1 million, out of a total of 28 million television homes.
These figures are based on BARB Establishment Survey data, according to which the total number of subscriptions to Netflix, Amazon and NOW TV was 15.4 million.
However, that includes households with multiple on-demand services.
Netflix had 9.1 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2018, while Amazon had 4.8 million, that leaves NOW TV with 1.5 million.
The number of homes with at least one of these services is 11.1 million, or just under 40% of the country.
These three services are not entirely comparable. While Netflix is a pure online video subscription service, Amazon comes with a Prime shopping account, and NOW TV from Sky is effectively an unbundled pay television service available over broadband.
The BARB survey does not include NOW TV as a pay television subscription service, although Sky includes it in its subscriber data.
The BARB data is based on a continuous survey of around 53,000 households a year, carried out by Ipsos MORI.
A separate survey, the GfK SVod Tracker, based on around 3,000 respondents, indicates that 29% of those subscribing to online video services have both Netflix and Amazon, while 12% have Netflix, Amazon and NOW TV.
The majority of them also have a traditional pay television service, with 71% also subscribing to traditional pay television.
Netflix is available in conjunction with Virgin Media and BT, and will be available with Sky. BT has announced plans to offer access to Amazon Prime Video through its YouView boxes.
So have online video subscriptions overtaken pay television? Not really. Not yet.
Anyway, moving on. What about revenue?
Television subscription revenue declined by 2.7% in 2017 in real terms, although at £6.4 billion it accounted for 57% of all commercial broadcast television revenues.
Ofcom estimates online subscription revenue to have grown by 35% to £895 million, based on data from Ampere Analysis and Zenith Media. That is about 14% of the value of television subscriptions.
So has online subscription video revenue overtaken that for pay television? No. Not even close.
Turning to viewing, of the average 5 hours 11 minutes of video that individuals watched per day, 71% originated from broadcast television, and 58% was watched live on the television set. Subscription video services accounted for an average of 18 minutes per day. Broadcaster video services, like iPlayer and ITV Hub account for an average of just 9 minutes per day, with just 3 minutes of that viewed on devices other than the television.
Those aged 16-34 watch a similar amount of video to other age groups, at 4 hours 48 minutes a day, including about an hour and half of live television, but 54% of their viewing does not originate from broadcast television and 34% of their viewing is on devices other than a television set. This group spends an average of just under an hour a day on YouTube. For them, subscription video services account for 30 minutes a day of viewing, while broadcaster video services represent just 11 minutes a day.
So has online subscription viewing overtaken that for broadcast television? Not remotely.
However, it is clear that there is a change in viewing, particularly among younger viewers.
Overall, the amount of time spent viewing broadcast television on the television in the United Kingdom has fallen for the sixth successive year, from just over 4 hours in 2010 to 3 hours 23 minutes in 2017. That is still a total of 4.41 trillion minutes of broadcast television viewing.
Only 64 programmes had an audience of more than 10 minutes viewers in 2017, compared to 253 in 2010.
Those aged over 54, who make up 28% of the United Kingdom population, account for more than half of all broadcast television viewing.
The sharpest declines in viewing are among children, aged 4-15, down from 151 minutes a day in 2010 to 86 in 2017, and young adults aged 16-24, down from 169 minutes to 100 minutes a day.
Only 78% of those aged 16-24 now watch television for at least 15 consecutive minutes a week.
Sharon White, the chief executive of Ofcom, said the research has profound implications for television in the United Kingdom.
“We have seen a decline in revenues for pay TV, a fall in spending on new programmes by our public service broadcasters, and the growth of global video streaming giants. These challenges cannot be underestimated,” she said.
“UK broadcasters have a history of adapting to change. By making the best British programmes and working together to reach people who are turning away from TV, our broadcasters can compete in the digital age.”
Ofcom, which now regulates the BBC, as well as other broadcasters licensed in the United Kingdom, has repeatedly signalled sympathy towards the public service broadcasters working together to offer online video services.
Such an initiative has been called Kangaroo two, after an earlier joint venture was blocked on competition grounds.
The first annual Media Nations report is available from the Ofcom web site, together with a useful interactive data tool."

Sorry for the tardy reply. I have invoked a temporary self-depravation of ECF until I finish my concentrate reorganization. The procrastinator in me, would rather read about it, than do it. So, until I get it done, I am not keeping up.
I still check in every day (or so) to check for tags and PMs. But, otherwise, I will have some catching up to do.
As to your question:
Yes; 1% of 30mL is 0.30mL (Not "".3%"" as you wrote; but I think that was just a typo.).
If you have created a dilution of 1% Italian Cream, and only want to use only 1% of that dilution, then you are correct. That is going to incorporate only 0.0001 of the original/full strength concentrate.
1% of 1% = 0.01 x 0.01 = 0.0001 = 0.01% = one ten thousandth of the original concentrate.
The most common dilution I am familiar with is a 10% (0.10) dilution. And, that dilution, is then treated like a traditional concentrate. This is how I have seen other mixers make using otherwise difficult-to-use ingredients, like FA Condensed Milk, Acetyl Pyrazine, and FLV Rich Cinnamon, easier to control minimal adjustments.
By doing so (the 10% dilution), I have to use 10 times the volume, to get the same effect, as the original concentrate. If I were to do a 1% dilution; I would have to use 100 times the volume, to get the same effect.
That doesn't mean a mixer can't use a 1% dilution as a concentrate... I just have not heard of it being done. Click to expand... HI All,

But it was the mechanisation revolution of the Sixties that really put him to the test. Bridges knew he couldn't turn back the tide. So he set out a different question: how to win for his members “a piece of the machine”. The challenge, said Bridges, was how to get the machines working for the workers and not against them. That question – the “Bridges test”– is once again the challenge for progressives as we face the future of work. There is much to alarm us. Think of James Bloodworth's chilling account of life in an Amazon warehouse, where ubiquitous monitors have become what my friend Clive Efford calls the digital “butty man”; deciding who gets paid what at the end of the week. Or the death of DPD driver Don Lane, who worked himself to death in fear of the firm's penalties for slowness. Or Deliveroo's court-won freedom not to pay minimum wage or holiday pay. The statistics behind the stories are even worse: 10 per cent of UK jobs are at risk of significant change. But the sectors hit fastest and hardest – retail and transportation – are those that employ the majority of the British working class. We could lose more working-class jobs than during the shutdown of coal, steel and shipbuilding combined."

The heavens and the world were witness to your union and off you went to live happily ever after.
Time has passed and unfortunately, the same time that ought to have cemented your love for each other has done the opposite: eroded most of what you felt for each other and now your relationship is not as it used to be or what you wanted it to be.

Here We Go Again at the Apollo in Hammersmith, London, Britain
By Rebecca Rubin
LOS ANGELES ( Variety.com ) - In a twist ending straight out of a movie, ""The Equalizer 2"" shot past ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again' to steal the box office crown.
Going into the weekend, it looked like ""Mamma Mia! 2"" would easily debut at No. 1. Final numbers won't come in until Monday, but weekend estimates show Sony's ""The Equalizer"" sequel opened above estimates with $35.8 million when it launched in 3,388 locations, while Universal's highly anticipated follow-up to ""Mamma Mia!"" debuted with $34.4 million from 3,317 screens.
""Equalizer 2,"" the first sequel of Denzel Washington's nearly four-decade long career, launched ahead of its predecessor. 2014's ""The Equalizer"" opened with $35 million and went on to generate $192 million worldwide, including $101 million domestically.
Antoine Fuqua returned to direct ""The Equalizer 2,"" which also stars Pedro Pascal, Ashton Sanders, Melissa Leo, and Bill Pullman. Though it got a head start on the original film, reception has been less enthusiastic for the sequel, which currently holds a tepid 50 percent average on Rotten Tomatoes.
Though ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again"" couldn't dance its way to the top of the domestic box office, its $34 million opening is still a win. The original ""Mamma Mia!"" hit theatres a decade ago with $27 million. It became a box office hit, amassing $615 million worldwide on a $52 million budget. Much like the first film, the sequel will likely be a smash overseas, where Swedish pop group ABBA has a huge following.
Much of the star-studded cast -- including Amanda Seyfried, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard, Colin Firth, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, and Dominic Cooper -- returned for the second film. Lily James made her debut as a the younger version of Meryl Streep's charming and carefree Donna, while living legend Cher also joined the cast. Ol Parker, the screenwriter behind ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"" took over directing duties and penned the script.
The final wide release of the weekend, BH Tilt's ""Unfriended: Dark Web,"" got off to a scary start. The low-budget horror film debuted way below projections with $3.5 million from 1,546 locations. That might not matter, considering the Blumhouse title carries a $1 million price tag. ""Dark Web"" is a standalone sequel to 2015's ""Unfriended."" That film became a cash cow, opening with $15 million and going on to earn $64 million from a $41 million budget.
""The Grudge"" and ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" writer Stephen Susco made his directorial debut with ""Dark Web,"" which features Colin Woodell, Rebecca Rittenhouse, Betty Gabriel, and Andrew Lees.
Among holdovers, ""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" nabbed third place during its second outing. Sony's animated sequel picked up another $23 million from 4,267 locations, bringing its domestic tally to $91 million.
In fourth, Marvel's ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" pocketed $16 million from 3,778 screens in its third frame. In total, the Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily-led superhero blockbuster has made $165 million.
Disney-Pixar's ""Incredibles 2"" rounded out the top five with $11.3 million. In six weeks, the animated sequel has earned a massive $557 million in North America.
Meanwhile, Dwayne Johnson's ""Skyscraper"" continues to struggle in North America. Universal's action adventure dropped 56% in its sophomore weekend, collecting $11 million in 3,822 locations. The studio is hoping for massive returns internationally, where it opens this weekend in China.
At the speciality box office, Lionsgate's ""Blindspotting"" bowed with $332,500 when it opened in 14 theatres. That's a solid per-screen-average of $23,750. Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal co-wrote and star in ""Blindspotting, which debuted to raves at this year's Sundance Film Festival.
Bleecker Street's ""McQueen,"" a documentary chronicling the life of iconic fashion designer Alexander McQueen, landed the top theatre average of the weekend with $24,232. It scored $96,928 when it opened in four theatres.
Another new offering, Amazon Studios' ""Generation Wealth,"" bowed on four screens with $33,602 for a per-theatre-average of $8,401. More From Entertainment "

Vacation time has arrived…the family is now in Tuscany in Italy. We rented a vacation house with a pool and jacuzzi. Take a look at our current vacation house in the mountains close to Lucca.
Vacation time is the time where I can grab a couple of books for reading. I don’t like reading all the time in one book. So I grabbed a few books from my library and read as I like..
Below you can find a picture of the 4 books that I brought along. The 4 Books I am reading… Emotional Intelligence 2.0 – Travis Bradberry & Jean Greave We start with a quote of the Dalia Lama : “Emotional Intelligence 2.0 succinctly explains how to deal with emotions creatively and employ our intelligence in a beneficial way.” Emotional intelligence isn’t my strongest character trait. This is the reason I purchased the book.
For the first time ever in a book, TalentSmart’s revolutionary program helps people identify their EQ skills, build these skills into strengths, and enjoy consistent performance in the pursuit of important life objectives. The book contains proven strategies from a decade-long effort to accurately measure and increase emotional intelligence. Trusted by upper-echelon leaders inside companies worldwide, these strategies will enable you to capitalize on the skills responsible for 58% of performance in all types of jobs. It includes a passcode for online access to the world’s bestselling emotional intelligence test, the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal®, which will show you where your EQ stands today and what you can do to begin maximizing it immediately.
Rooted in sound research involving more than 500,000 responses, this new edition of the test will:
–Pinpoint which of the book’s 66 emotional intelligence strategies will increase your EQ the most.
–Reveal the specific behaviors responsible for your EQ scores.
–Allow you to test yourself a second time to measure how much your EQ has increased from your efforts.
The book’s smooth narrative style turns rigorous research into memorable stories and practical strategies that anyone can use to his or her advantage.
With 90% of top performers high in EQ, and EQ twice as important as IQ in getting where you want to go in life, who can afford to ignore it?
Here are two quotes what other people are saying about it:
“Gives abundant, practical findings and insights with emphasis on how to develop EQ. Research shows convincingly that EQ is more important than IQ.”–Stephen R. Covey, author, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
“This book can drastically change the way you think about success…read it twice.”–Patrick Lencioni, author, The Five Dysfunctions of a Team
I also have the two above books in my library. The Post-American World – Fareed Zakaria
What Does A ‘Post-American World’ Look Like? This book dates from 2008. We are now 10 years later. A good moment to reflect on what this author wrote… Dubai now boasts the world’s largest building, Burj Khalifa. Zakaria says the world is now experiencing what he calls “the rise of the rest,” where countries around the world are growing at previously unthinkable rates. Thirty years ago, the United States dominated the world politically, economically and scientifically. But today?
“The tallest building in the world is now in Dubai, the biggest factory in the world is in China, the largest oil refinery is in India, the largest investment fund in the world is in Abu Dhabi, the largest Ferris wheel in the world is in Singapore,” notes Fareed Zakaria. “And … more troublingly, the United States is also losing its key grip on indices such as patent creation, scientific creations and things like that — which are really harbingers of future economic growth.”
Zakaria, the host of CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS and an editor at large for Time magazine, charts the fall of America’s dominance and the simultaneous rise of the rest of the world in his book The Post-American World.
“The result is you have countries all over the world thriving and taking advantage of the political stability they have achieved, the economic connections of a global market, the technological connection into this market,” he tells Fresh Air ‘s Terry Gross. “And we are all witnesses to this phenomenon.”
America, Zakaria says, is also starting to lag behind other countries in education, building a competitive workforce, and fostering new energy and digital infrastructure to support those workers — all markers of long-term economic growth. He says America is now heading toward what he calls a “post-American” world, in which the United States’ share of the “global pie” is much smaller — as the rest of the globe begins to catch up.
“In economic terms, the rise of the rest of the globe is a win-win,” he says. “The more countries that get rich [and] the larger the world economy, the more people there are producing, consuming, investing, saving, loaning money. … If we didn’t have the rest of the world growing, the United States economy would be in much worse shape than it is today.”
But Zakaria cautions that the economic growth around the world — and the benefits that global economic stability create — do not extend to the political arena.
“Politics and power is a realm of relative influence,” he says. “So as China expands its role in Asia, whose role is diminishing? Of course, the established power — the United States. It’s not possible for two countries to be the leading dominant political power at the same time.”
On what might happen if the U.S. defaults on debt
“I tend to think it will be catastrophic. I think, more importantly, there is a high enough risk here that this is surely a game we don’t want to play. … There are events that economics call low-probability, high-impact events that you don’t want to test. You don’t want to see if this is one of those things that is an unlikely situation but once it happens could have a huge seismic global effect, because then the cost of dealing with the after-effects is just cataclysmic.” Trade Options with an Edge – Dr. Russell Richards
Dr. Russell Richards reveals ‘Trade Options with an Edge’. This book guides readers in finding effective option trades to maximize their profits. This gentlemen started when he was retired !! Drawing from his vast knowledge gained from many years of trading, trying many different approaches, experiencing success and failures with traditional approaches, Dr. Russell Richards attempts to convince retail investors that they can manage their own money better than most mutual funds, hedge funds or financial advisors. He introduces the tastytrade approach to investing with options in his new book, “Trade Options with an Edge” (published by Xlibris).
According to Richards, options provide the most efficient way to trade equities. If an investor has an edge in an options trade, he will consistently generate small profits much like a casino does. The investor needs only make lots of small trades, each with an edge and manage the trades actively. The investor should expect to generate profits of 1 percent to 2 percent or more each month in any type of market: up, down or sideways. “The approach to trading options is very mechanical. It debunks some of the widely held beliefs about investing,” Richards says. “Instead of focusing on stock selection as the key to making money in the stock market, this book focuses on identifying opportunities that provide an edge. It provides a very mechanical method for selecting strategies and managing positions. “
Informative and insightful, “Trade Options with an Edge” guides readers in understanding how to manage and grow the money that they have. Software to support options trading is provided with the book.

Here We Go Again at the Apollo in Hammersmith, London, Britain
By Rebecca Rubin
LOS ANGELES ( Variety.com ) - In a twist ending straight out of a movie, ""The Equalizer 2"" shot past ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again' to steal the box office crown.
Going into the weekend, it looked like ""Mamma Mia! 2"" would easily debut at No. 1. Final numbers won't come in until Monday, but weekend estimates show Sony's ""The Equalizer"" sequel opened above estimates with $35.8 million when it launched in 3,388 locations, while Universal's highly anticipated follow-up to ""Mamma Mia!"" debuted with $34.4 million from 3,317 screens.
""Equalizer 2,"" the first sequel of Denzel Washington's nearly four-decade long career, launched ahead of its predecessor. 2014's ""The Equalizer"" opened with $35 million and went on to generate $192 million worldwide, including $101 million domestically.
Antoine Fuqua returned to direct ""The Equalizer 2,"" which also stars Pedro Pascal, Ashton Sanders, Melissa Leo, and Bill Pullman. Though it got a head start on the original film, reception has been less enthusiastic for the sequel, which currently holds a tepid 50 percent average on Rotten Tomatoes.
Though ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again"" couldn't dance its way to the top of the domestic box office, its $34 million opening is still a win. The original ""Mamma Mia!"" hit theatres a decade ago with $27 million. It became a box office hit, amassing $615 million worldwide on a $52 million budget. Much like the first film, the sequel will likely be a smash overseas, where Swedish pop group ABBA has a huge following.
Much of the star-studded cast -- including Amanda Seyfried, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard, Colin Firth, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, and Dominic Cooper -- returned for the second film. Lily James made her debut as a the younger version of Meryl Streep's charming and carefree Donna, while living legend Cher also joined the cast. Ol Parker, the screenwriter behind ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"" took over directing duties and penned the script.
The final wide release of the weekend, BH Tilt's ""Unfriended: Dark Web,"" got off to a scary start. The low-budget horror film debuted way below projections with $3.5 million from 1,546 locations. That might not matter, considering the Blumhouse title carries a $1 million price tag. ""Dark Web"" is a standalone sequel to 2015's ""Unfriended."" That film became a cash cow, opening with $15 million and going on to earn $64 million from a $41 million budget.
""The Grudge"" and ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" writer Stephen Susco made his directorial debut with ""Dark Web,"" which features Colin Woodell, Rebecca Rittenhouse, Betty Gabriel, and Andrew Lees.
Among holdovers, ""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" nabbed third place during its second outing. Sony's animated sequel picked up another $23 million from 4,267 locations, bringing its domestic tally to $91 million.
In fourth, Marvel's ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" pocketed $16 million from 3,778 screens in its third frame. In total, the Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily-led superhero blockbuster has made $165 million.
Disney-Pixar's ""Incredibles 2"" rounded out the top five with $11.3 million. In six weeks, the animated sequel has earned a massive $557 million in North America.
Meanwhile, Dwayne Johnson's ""Skyscraper"" continues to struggle in North America. Universal's action adventure dropped 56% in its sophomore weekend, collecting $11 million in 3,822 locations. The studio is hoping for massive returns internationally, where it opens this weekend in China.
At the speciality box office, Lionsgate's ""Blindspotting"" bowed with $332,500 when it opened in 14 theatres. That's a solid per-screen-average of $23,750. Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal co-wrote and star in ""Blindspotting, which debuted to raves at this year's Sundance Film Festival.
Bleecker Street's ""McQueen,"" a documentary chronicling the life of iconic fashion designer Alexander McQueen, landed the top theatre average of the weekend with $24,232. It scored $96,928 when it opened in four theatres.
Another new offering, Amazon Studios' ""Generation Wealth,"" bowed on four screens with $33,602 for a per-theatre-average of $8,401. More From Entertainment "

But Snapchat will abandon the peer-to-peer payment space on August 30th. Code buried in Snapchat's Android app includes a ""Snapcash deprecation message"" that displays ""Snapcash will no longer be available after %s [date]"". Shutting down the feature will bring an end to Snapchat's four-year partnership with Square to power the feature for sending people money.
Snapcash may have become more of a liability than a utility. With apps like Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, and Square Cash itself, there were plenty of other ways to pay back friends for drinks or Ubers, so Snapcash may have seen low legitimate usage. Meanwhile, a quick Twitter search for ""Snapcash"" surfaced plenty of offers of erotic content in exchange for payments through the feature. It may have been safer for Snapchat to ditch Snapcash than risk PR problems over its misuse.
TechCrunch tipster Ishan Agarwal provided the below screenshot of Snapchat's code to TechCrunch. When presented with the code and asked if Snapcash would shut down, a Snapchat spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that it would, explaining: ""Yes, we're discontinuing the Snapcash feature as of August 30, 2018. Snapcash was our first product created in partnership with another company - Square. We're thankful for all the Snapchatters who used Snapcash for the last four years and for Square's partnership!"" The spokesperson noted that users would be notified in-app and through the support site soon.
Snapcash gave Snapchat a way to get users to connect payment methods to the app. That's increasingly important as the company aims to become a commerce platforms where you can shop without leaving the app. Having payment info on file is what makes buying things through Snapchat easier than the web and draws brands to use Snapchat storefronts.
We'll see how Snapchat plans evolve its commerce strategy without this driver. Earlier this month, TechCrunch revealed that Snapchat's code contained mentions of a project codenamed ""eagle"" that's a camera search feature. It was designed to allow users to scan an object or barcode with their Snapchat camera and see product results in Amazon. But since our report, mentions of Amazon have disappeared from the code. It's unclear what will happen in the future, but camera search could give Snapchat new utility and monetization options.
Snapcash won't be a part of that future, though. Given Snapchat's cost-cutting efforts including layoffs , its desperate need to attract and retain advertisers to hit revenue estimates its missed, and its persistent bad rap as a sexting app, it couldn't afford to support unnecessary features or another scandal.

Serverless Cloud Computing is a great example of both the dynamism of Cloud services and also how this infrastructure evolution is changing the very nature of software engineering itself.
Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity. [1] It is a form of utility computing .
For example AWS offers this beginners guide for setting up your first serverless application. Skyscanner
It is an ideal technology and service model for startups: Literally, pay only when your service is active, billed only for what you use. Not only that but a development paradigm that emphasizes rapid delivery of new, modular digital services.
Skyscanner is one key poster child for the Scottish tech sector, marking the first ‘unicorn’ through becoming the nation’s first billion dollar startup , harnessing the power of the Cloud to do so. Listen to CEO / Co-founder of Skyscanner Gareth Williams explain how
fundamentally they are a software company living in the age of continuous deployment.
As they describe in their tech blog they’ve sought to emulate the global digital pioneers of these trends notably Netflix, synonomous in the tech sector with cutting edge ‘Cloud Native’ approaches that best exploit the power of massive providers like Amazon, referring to a software architecture that utilizes ‘microservices’, breaking large unwieldy single ‘monoliths’ of code into small, interlinked modules.
As Phil Dalbeck Principal Engineer for Skyscanner describes in this Slideshare presentation they too have leveraged AWS to make this dramatic growth possible and scalable, also implementing best practices to ensure their information security. Also highlighting another key trend, ‘multi-cloud’, making use of multiple Cloud providers to fulfil all your business needs, they’ve also adopted Salesforce.com for their sales team to use. Skyscanner from Amazon Web Services
The industry has since made another evolutionary leap forward, one that further lowers the barrier for new digital entrepreneurs, what is called ‘Serverless’ computing, implemented through services including AWS Lamda .
As the name suggests, and as Professor Bill Buchanan of Napier University describes in his Linkedin blog , this represents the ultimate pinnacle of the Cloud computing trend, a complete abstraction away from the underlying mechanics of IT, freeing developers to focus entirely on the value add software they’re creating. They never have to meddle with any aspects of the servers or other infrastructure components, the parts that don’t add new value.
Critically for entrepreneurs is the point that it’s implemented entirely On Demand. Other AWS services offer a utility pricing model yes, linking pricing to usage but it’s not entirely fluid, requiring reservation of resources for example. In contrast Lamda is entirely ‘event-driven’, it activates and operates only for the time the software is called and executed, and customers are billed only for that exact usage.
This Silicon Angle article captures the essence of the opportunity – Entrepreneur Ryan Kroonenburg has built the world’s first ‘Serverless Startup’, a business model based entirely on leveraging this capability.
On Demand is the ideal model for startups, you incur costs only at the time you generate the associated sale, every transaction is profitable, but to date it’s been a utopian ideal not a realistic possibility. Serverless now brings that utopia to the real world, and for Scottish startups who don’t have access to the same investment capital as their USA counterparts but compensate for this through a wealth of ingenuity and creativity, it offers a hyper-accelerating rocket fuel for our innovation economy."

Whoopi’s Outburst is Helping the Judge in a BIG WAY! Judge Jeanine Just Got the LAST LAUGH! Whoopi’s Outburst is Helping the Judge in a BIG WAY! 11:01 news
The best revenge is success.
And no one is enjoying that type of revenge more than Judge Jeanine Pirro, who was verbally assaulted and “spit” on by lunatic liberal “The View” host Whoopi Goldberg.
After her appearance on ABC’s “The View,” where Whoopi Goldberg attacked her both on and off the set, Judge Jeanine’s new book has skyrocketed to #1 Amazon’s bestsellers list.
From Bizpacreview.com
Success is the best revenge. Just ask Judge Jeanine Pirro, whose book, Liars, Leakers, and Liberals , shot to No. 1 on the Amazon bestsellers list after Trump-hating liberal Whoopi Goldberg yelled and spit on her.
During the opening statement on her Fox News show, Judge Jeanine sarcastically thanked Whoopi for helping her new book become an instant bestseller.
“I do want to thank Whoopi and the ladies of The View for helping to make my book Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy hit No. 1 on Amazon and Barnes & Noble,” Pirro said. “So go out and get a copy if you haven’t already.”
As BizPac Review previously reported, Pirro said Goldberg repeatedly yelled “F- you!” and spit at her during an off-camera scuffle following their explosive on-air confrontation on “The View.”
Judge Jeanine had gone on the liberal talk show to promote her book but instead was yelled at, silenced, and thrown off the set for supporting President Trump.

On her Fox News show “Justice With Judge Jeanine,” Pirro said she’s not scared of Whoopi or anyone else who tries to silence her. “I’m a big girl. No one intimidates me,” Pirro said.
The former prosecutor and judge then slammed today’s radical liberals for fomenting faux outrage and inciting violent bullying and harassment of Trump supporters.
“The level of hatred toward the 45th president of the United States is beyond anything we’ve seen in American history,” Pirro said.
Pirro said liberals who embrace mob bullying of political opponents and protest ICE and longstanding federal immigration laws aren’t just undermining Trump, but the entire country.
“What you’re doing is tearing down America. You’re tearing down the values of the United States. Everyone has the right to speak.
But when you can’t even listen to what someone has to say because you despise the man who is president, you undermine not the president…you undermine the United States. “
Judge Jeanine closed by saying that we should “agree to disagree” with political opponents.
She then took a dig at Goldberg, who said the following on Friday’s episode of the The View: “Jeanine, good luck with your book. I hear it is No. 1. I preferred your last book about Robert Durst, but there is no accounting for taste.”
Pirro responded by saying:
“To Whoopi, I accept that you and I have different versions of what happened both on and off the air and we have completely different takes on President Trump and the job he’s doing. So let’s agree to disagree and put this episode to bed once and for all.
Thanks, Whoopi, and may I say that I preferred you in the movie ‘Ghost’ much more than on ‘The View.’ But then again, we are all entitled to our opinions.”
Judge Jeanine is right about leftists wanting to destroy America.

I'm about to try it again but I'm going to try paint the solution on more carefully and also maybe try a lower heat but take longer over the areas
If that fails, you can get high temperature clear lacquer if that's the problem. It's not too dear. Here's a UK example:
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tech-Xtremely-Temperature-LACQUER-Exhaust/dp/B00ZXZP480
I suspect the Rustoleum spray is more temperature tolerant than normal lacquers; it's got 'enamel' in its name.

Made sure Amazon was the seller to help avoid any risk of non-genuine Samsung parts. Just arrived and burned each one in briefly using CrystalDiskMark, so I could both be sure each worked and compare speeds between the units. All three tested within about 2% of each other on each benchmark. Importantly, the sequential read speeds exceeded the claimed 200 MB/s in each case, averaging 224 MB/s. Writes were all 34MB/s. All tests were conducted on my laptop, a Lenovo Flex5, on a USB 3.0 port. Clearly the sequential read speeds take advantage of USB3.0 bandwidth.
Overall very pleased for the price and the key chain friendly stainless steel casing. Note I did put a cover on the USB end of each, using the covers from Honbay 40pcs Semitransparent Black and Clear Plastic USB Male Anti-Dust Plug Stopper Cap Cover . I wanted just a bit more protection when used on key chains from dents and the elements. These Honbay covers fit snugly yet come off relatively easily. These feel like TPR, which is good for grip and flexibility.
Pros
+Fairly fast overall for the price, and clearly very fast at sequential reads.
+Good looking, tough stainless steel body
+Great form factor for handling - only as wide as a USB port so they won't cause any interference with adjacent ports, a bit longer than the really small USB drives designed to stay mounted all the time, but therefore very easy to get in and out, especially with the raised end near the lanyard hole providing a nice grip.
+Hangs just fine on my key chain, a Maxpedition Gear Keyper Maxpedition Gear Keyper, Foliage Green using a FREEkey ring, the absolutely most secure rings you can buy in my experience FREEkey Accessory Ring Spares, 10 Count
Cons
-wish for faster write speeds
-gets warm but not so hot as to be a concern so far
No data yet on reliability, will updated if I find any issues.

I’ve been using it regularly since then.
My main use for it is to hold a copy of my library of FLAC, MP3, AAC, and ALAC files. It’s usually plugged into my network streamer. Whenever I purchase new FLAC tracks, I download them to my computer, write them to this drive, and then plug the drive into the streamer.
I’ve also used it to move large amounts of JPG and RAW photos from one computer to another.
Read/write speeds are as advertised, which is faster than any of the dozen or so USB drives I’ve owned. Build quality is excellent - the drive is tough as nails, yet the champagne color is elegant. It doesn’t feel hot when reading or writing large amounts of files or when plugged in to my computer for long periods of time.
It’s not the smallest USB drive for sure. It sticks out about an inch. But it doesn’t FEEL large and clunky to me, the way some heavy-duty drives do.
Highly recommended.
May I also just say: $45 for 128gb of storage is incredible. There are $1000 Apple laptops that have only 128gb of storage."

Consumer estimates collated by S&P Global Market Intelligence put the company’s revenue at $53.4bn for the quarter, at an increase of about 40 per cent year-on-year.

Earnings per share are forecast at $2.54, which would be an increase of more than 500 per cent thanks to some strategic investments in new industries like healthcare and an expansion of its fulfilment and logistics capabilities.
While its globally market-dominant cloud service AWS largely bears responsibility for its meteoric growth, analysts suggest Amazon’s e-commerce offering and own-brand tech products are likely to be the fundamental contributors to its financial success in 2018.

Roger Barr, co-founder of digital agency Mediablaze, said: ""Amazon’s core e-commerce offering is likely to be the fundamental contributor to financial success.
""However, it’s continued investment into other revenue streams such as content on Prime Video are likely to have an impact on long term growth and profitability.""
Amazon's key competitor to its music-streaming service, Spotify , is also set to report its second quarter results on Thursday.
Analysts at Barclays predicted a 24.8 per cent revenue growth for the quarter in a note last Friday, with no profitability in sight for the young company. Share"

We welcome you again to the world of speculative fiction, where there are no limits for what an individual can accomplish—except in the mind of the writer. Often, while we can create entire worlds out of our imaginations, stories of adventure and daring do have been limited to male characters, based on the belief that women in Earths’ history did not live adventurous or public lives.
In this series , we would like to counter that notion with examples of women who did just that, lived lives of excitement and public importance. We hope that the lives of these women inspire you to reach beyond the common narrative and to give voices to extraordinary women in your own stories.
Meet Ching Shih (1775 – 1846) Ching Shih was arguably the greatest pirate to have ever lived. She sailed the South China Seas during the middle Qing period and at the height of her power commanded over 1,800 junks and up to 80,000 pirates, depending on sources.
She was born in 1775 as Shi Yang and while little is known of her early life we do know she worked in a Cantonese brothel when she was young. In 1801 she married a famous pirate from a large pirate family, Cheng I, who rumor has it, sought her out for her keen business acumen. She helped Cheng I to create a pirate armada out of rival Cantonese fleets, many of which led by Cheng’s own relatives, eventually forming the infamous Red Flag Fleet.
In 1807 Cheng I died, leaving Shi Yang to take the name Ching Shih (Cheng’s widow) and to consolidate power. She allied with her adopted step-son and Cheng I’s lover, Cheung Po Tsai, setting him up as the titular head of the fleet while she maintained actual control. She also took him as her own lover. Cheung Po would manage the day-to-day operations of the fleet while taking commands from Ching Shih.
Ching Shih also codified a new set of laws for the Red Flag Fleet to follow, and no matter how small a ship, these laws were ordered to be on display for all to see. Notably, she set special rules for female captives, protecting them from rape and coercion by threat of death, and enforcing fidelity on the part of their male partners in the event that they married a pirate.
In 1808, the Chinese government made a concerted effort to destroy the Red Flag Fleet by barricading them behind an overwhelming blockade. Three weeks later, Ching Shih sailed away mostly unscathed, having taken over the government ships, leaving the Chinese navy with nothing more than fishing boats to fight with.
However, by 1810, infighting among the pirates had begun to take its toll and the Red Flag Fleet was in decline. Ching Shih turned her shrewd mind towards bargaining with the Chinese government, eventually winning freedom and a payout for her efforts, as well as for most of her pirates. In exchange for laying down arms, they would almost all walk away.
Ching Shih finally married Cheung Po (after having her adoption of him waived) and settled into life back to her roots as a madam of a brothel and gambling hall. She died at the ripe old age of 69, a well-respected business woman, having controlled the South China Seas for a spectacular handful of years.
As a historical figure, Ching Shih was fascinating. As a character, she could be amazing. At every turn, she exhibited agency in driving her own story, and disregarded the limitations society placed on her simply because of her sex. A character like Ching Shih would be one to remember.
For Discussion Imagine your favorite action story. What effects would swapping a male character for a female one have on the story? What would need to change? What could stay the same?

To many of us, backing up a Mac means setting up Time Machine and forgetting about it until we need to recover data. But, while Time Machine is a great resource, it's not perfect, and relying on it alone to keep your data safe is a mistake that could have disastrous consequences.
An ideal strategy consists of at least two separate backup schedules, with at least one of those backing up to a drive that's stored offsite. At the very least, if you use Time Machine to back up to an external hard drive or network device, you should also have another tool running regular backups to a different drive.
That means buying a backup application and using it, before you lose data. There are a number of different options when it comes to choosing backup software.
Some apps are focused on creating clones of your hard drive and offer incremental backup as an extra feature. Others are focused solely on making backing up your Mac regularly as easy as as possible.
A third category, represented in our round-up by ChronoSync , allows you to synchronise folders on your Mac with another drive or computer on a regular basis. Some FTP management applications also allow you to synchronise folders with FTP or WebDAV servers.
Finally, there are online services that will store your data on their servers, providing a secure offsite backup. When you initially sign up for an online service, the first backup will take a while, possibly several days.
But once you've completed that, each subsequent run only copies files that have changes and so will take much less time and bandwidth. Most of these services also allow you to control how much bandwidth they use so you should never find that they get in the way of you working.
Of the apps and services we look at here, Get Backup Pro is a simple and inexpensive backup tool, while ChronoSync , Carbon Copy Cloner and SuperDuper allow you to run incremental backups, through they're each focused on other tasks. The three online backup tools, Backblaze , Carbonite and IDrive all have merits and of those three, Backblaze edges it.
However, overall, for a combination of ease of use, features and the ability to combine local backups with backup to the cloud, the outstanding choice is Acronis True Image 2018. 1. Acronis True Image 2018
Acronis is a name well known in the Windows world, but less so to Mac users. True Image 18 is its personal backup solution and it supports backing up your data to a local disk, Acronis' own cloud-based service, or a network-attached storage device. The latter makes it good option for anyone with a NAS that doesn't support Apple's Time Machine.
You'll need to set up an account with Acronis to use the cloud service, but if you'd rather give True image a spin without creating an account, you can use the free trial to back up to a local drive or network disk.
True Image 2018 supports APFS drives, so if you're running High Sierra you won't run into difficulties. There is a caveat that may rule out True Image for some: It doesn't allow you to back up Bootcamp partitions, or indeed specify any partition on your drive to back up.
True Image creates images in a proprietary format when you back up to a local drive, so you'll need to use its restore tools to access your data. Cloud backups are saved on a per file basis.
Acronis True Image is very straightforward to use. The first time you open it, your Mac is selected as the source. Click the Destination button to choose whether to back up to Acronis Cloud, a local drive or a NAS box.
If you don't want to create an image of your entire Mac, click on the source box to choose files and folders to back up. From here, you can also back up external disks, a mobile device to your Mac or your social media accounts to Acronis Cloud.
Click on the settings icon and you can schedule regular backups, exclude files, encrypt backups or delete old backups.
Pricing starts at 34.99, which puts it in the middle of the tools tested here. But if you want to use Acronis Cloud, you'll pay a yearly subscription ranging from 34.99 for 250GB to 69.99 for 1TB. Yearly plans include the cost of the software.
Acronis True Image combines the best of local and online backup tools and while there are cheaper options in both categories, that flexibility means it is worth the extra cost. 2. Get Backup Pro
Get Backup Pro's main attraction is its flexibility.
It can back up your entire hard drive or only the folders you specify. You use it to create bootable clones of your Mac's startup drive, and to synchronise files and folders on different drives. Backups can be compressed to save space and you can choose whether to back up to a disk image or on a per file basis.
Scheduled backups take place in the background and Get Backup Pro shuts itself down once it's finished. And if the worst happens and you can't restart your Mac after a crash, you can restore to any Mac, even if it doesn't have Get Backup Pro installed.
Get Backup Pro doesn't have its own cloud service, so if you want to backup online as well as locally, you'll need to do that with a third-party tool. It will, however, back up to network volumes and even DVD media. You can choose to automatically mount network volumes when a backup schedule starts, but you can't specify files and folders to back up to a network disk: you must back up everything.
You can choose to encrypt backups and even the level of encryption, from AES-128, AES-256, Blowfish, or Triple DES. And, if you want to back up data from specific apps, Get Backup Pro allows you to create scheduled backups using templates for apps like iTunes, Mail, Photos and Contacts. There's also a template for the Documents folder.
Get Backup Pro's interface splits the application into four sections: Backup; Archive; Clone; and Synchronise. Backups are called projects. So, to start, you select the action you want from the tabs at the top of the left sidebar and create a new projects. From there, depending on the action you've chosen, you'll have different options to choose from.
Clicking the cog at the bottom of the sidebar reveals the configuration settings from where you can specify the destination, any files that are to be excluded and how and when the backup routine should run.
Perhaps Get Backup Pro's greatest strength is its simplicity. Press the '+' in the sidebar to create a new project, then as soon as you've named it the settings window opens. Once you chosen options from there and confirmed them, all that's left to do is add files.
You can do that by dragging folders into the application's main window, by pressing a button labelled 'files+', or by choosing a template. It's all very intuitive. If you need to start a backup manually, there's a big playhead button at the bottom of the main window; click it and the selected backup will start.
Add to that the fact that it's only $19.99 in the US and just over 18 in the UK, and Get Backup Pro is a very good choice indeed. 3. ChronoSync
Don't be fooled by its name. While ChronoSync has its roots in file synchronisation and still focuses on that, it's a robust, feature-filled and highly configurable backup tool too.
As you'd expect, you can manually run backups or schedule them and you can back up to a local hard drive or NAS box. ChronoSync also supports backing up to Google Cloud and Amazon S3 storage.
You can use it to back up one remote location to another using SFTP and even set the location to be an iPhone or iPad using the optional InterConneX app. If you want to back up files and folders to another Mac, you can do that too.
Backups are incremental, but ChronoSync doesn't just check the contents of a file for changes. If metadata has altered since the last backup, that will be reflected too. And backed-up files are copied to a temporary file and checked for integrity before the file on the destination volume is replaced with the new version.
ChronoSync can create two types of bootable clone: standard and mirrored. The former creates a bootable system on the destination volume, leaving other files on the volume intact. Mirror replaces the entire contents of the destination volume with files from the source.
Each time ChronoSync runs a backup, it moves the previous one to an archive folder - meaning if you need to restore a file from a version other than the most recent, you can. You configure how many archives are kept on a number of files or length of time basis, or a combination on the two. And archives can be compressed to save space.
Restoring from an archive doesn't have the same visual pizzazz as it does in Time Machine, but thanks to the Archive panel, it's relatively painless.
ChronoSync's interface is chock-full of options and that in itself may be enough to put you off if all you want it is a simple backup tool: Get Backup Pro or Acronis True Image are more straightforward options. However, if you need both synchronisation across multiple Macs and backup, it's worth persevering. 4. Backblaze
Backblaze is an online service that allows you to back up your Mac to its servers automatically or according to a schedule you set.
Once you create an account and select your plan (there's a 30-day free trial, too), you download the Mac app and get started. Backblaze is focused on simplicity, so it automatically chooses what to back up. That includes the contents of your Documents, Pictures, Movies and Music folders, but excludes your Applications folder. Backblaze also excludes some file types from being backed up, including .dmg disk images - that restriction can be switched off, however.
Backups are kept for 30 days, so you can restore from any that ran during that time. And, as you would expect, backups are incremental so only files that have changed since it last ran are copied. Data is encrypted and you can optionally add a six-digit passcode to provide an additional layer of security.
Be prepared to be patient the first time you run Backblaze - it has to copy everything to its servers, which can take several days. But after that, it's relatively speedy and runs in the background.
Bandwidth is throttled automatically when necessary, but you can intervene and set a limit if you want. There's no limit to the size of a single file, but you can set one if you'd prefer. And backups can include USB sticks and external hard drives, as long as they're plugged in at least once a month. There's not an overall limit on the data you can back up to your account.
When it comes to restoring your data, you have three options: you can restore via Backblaze's web interface or you can have files sent to you on a USB stick or hard drive for an additional fee. And there's a 100% refund if you return the USB stick or hard drive within 30 days, though you'll have to pay shipping and taxes.
You can view individual files and choose which ones to download. And you can view and share backed up files on an iPhone or iPad with the Backblaze mobile app .
The Locate your Computer service tracks your Mac's location to help you find it if it's stolen and, if it's still running backups, tell you its current IP address and show you recently backed-up data.
Backblaze's user interface comprises a menu bar item and a System Preferences pane. However, that pane is more like a fully fledged application, with options to exclude files, add folders and disks to the backup, and throttle bandwidth. It's simple and very Mac-like.
If you only need to back up one Mac, and particularly if you want to back up external disks, Backblaze's simplicity and price give it the edge over Carbonite and IDrive. 5. iDrive
IDrive is another online backup service. However, it differs from both Backblaze and Carbonite in a number of ways.
Firstly, it has a free tier - you can back up 5GB without paying anything. After that, though, it's more expensive than either of its competitors featured here.
Currently, the annual charge for the Personal tier is $52.12 for the first year and $70/year after that, but that only allows you to backup 2TB of data, while Backblaze and Carbonite allow unlimited data. However, that 2TB can be spread across multiple computers, whereas Backblaze and Carbonite limit you to one computer.
Also, if you prefer to restore by having data physically shipped to you, IDrive provides that for free for the first restore each year - though if you're outside the US you'll have to pay for the shipping.
Like Backblaze, IDrive also allows you to back up external hard drives. Even with external drives backing up, it's unlikely most people will breach the 2TB limit - bearing in mind that you're not backing up applications or system files.
However, IDrive doesn't delete files when it runs a new backup. That means you can roll back as far as you want when you come to restore, but it also means you'll fill up that 2TB more quickly.
Features like Rewind and Snapshots allow you to restore from earlier versions of files or snapshots of the complete data set. And all data is encrypted, with the option to set your own private encryption key.
The IDrive mobile app allows you not just to view and download files to a mobile device but to back up images, calendar events and contacts from your iPhone or iPad as well - though that may be redundant if you use iCloud Photos.
IDrive's user interface makes using it very straightforward. Your Desktop, Documents, Music and Pictures folders are automatically selected for backup, along with the contents of ~/Library/Mail.
To add other folders, click 'Change' at the bottom of the window - that's not exactly intuitive. You can add videos to the backup, but locating them in IDrive's interface takes a great deal of doing.
Both scheduling and restoring are straightforward, however. As is choosing a local drive as the destination for a backup in place of IDrive's servers.
IDrive's free tier and the ability to spread your data allocation in the paid tiers across multiple computers makes it attractive. Overall, though, it's expensive for a single machine. 6. Carbon Copy Cloner 5
Carbon Copy Cloner is primarily a tool for creating bootable clones of your Mac's startup drive, hence its name. However, it has evolved to become a great deal more than that and now offers features that are a match for the best backup tools.
You can back up your Mac, or files and folders on it, to a local drive or one on a network. Backups can be scheduled to run at set times or triggered by events, such as plugging in a drive. And, as you would expect, backups are incremental, replacing only the files on the destination that have changed on the source since the last time.
Backup sets are managed using what Carbon Copy Cloner calls 'Tasks'. A task could be cloning your entire hard drive or, for example, backing up your iTunes library or Documents folder.
Tasks can be scheduled individually or grouped and run simultaneously. You can even easy chain tasks to create a sophisticated backup routine. Tasks can be viewed in the Task History window and you can filter by task name, source, destination or run date.
The SafetyNet feature keeps copies of previous backups when files are overwritten, allowing you to access older versions. And if you run out of room, CCC is smart enough to delete the oldest files and continue the backup.
Carbon Copy Cloner's interface is very well laid out. Its main window focuses on three things: source volume, destination volume, and schedule.
Tips, in the form of yellow 'sticky notes' can be switched on or off and allow you to see what every element in the interface does. The Cloning Coach guides you step by step through the process of creating backups and alerts you to potential problems with your strategy. And the guided restore does the same when you come to restore data from a backup.
Carbon Copy Cloner is, for the most part, very easy to use, and if the hand holding becomes an irritant, you can switch off the tips feature. When it comes to restoring individual files and folders, however, it's less obvious than some of its competitors. The quickest way to restore is to mount the cloned volume and drag and drop files in the Finder. You can also create a task to copy files.
As a tool for both cloning disks and backing up data, Carbon Copy Cloner is first rate. For pure backup, however, Acronis True Image is a better bet. 7. Carbonite Safe
Carbonite is very similar to Backblaze in that it allows you to back up your Mac to remote servers and recover files when you need to. Like Backblaze, you sign up for an account and download a Mac application, and it automatically selects files to download.
Also like Backblaze, Carbonite doesn't back up applications or system files. One key difference is that Carbonite's basic plan doesn't automatically back up the contents of your Movies folder either - although you can select videos manually to be backed up. Neither does Carbonite back up the contents of external drives.
Files are protected with 128-bit encryption, but there's no option to add your own password.
Restoring data is done online, using the Carbonite application - the option to ship media containing your data is only available within the US. And you can restore from any backup run within the last 30 days, allowing you to roll back to earlier versions of files.
The Carbonite mobile app allows you to view and download files to an iPhone or iPad.
Carbonite is very simple to use. In fact, it almost feels too simple. Download the app, install it and launch it, and Carbonite starts backing up your Documents and Pictures folders straight away.
In the lefthand sidebar, there's a list of volumes and the main user folders (Desktop, Documents, Pictures, Movies and Music). By clicking on those you can select files to be backed up or excluded.
Carbonite's welcome email warns that your initial backup could take several days. But that's the norm for online backup services, and as it runs in the background and is careful not to occupy too much bandwidth or computer resource, it's barely noticeable. Subsequent backups are much quicker.
We did notice that Carbonite's user interface hadn't been optimised for Retina displays , which is odd, five years after their introduction.
Restoring files is just as easy. If you want to restore a complete backup, click the Restore option in the sidebar and choose whether to download files to a folder or put them back where they were originally.
To restore individual files and folders, navigate to them using the folders in the sidebar and choose the download option.
Carbonite starts at $71.99 per year for a single computer, but if you want to back up external drives and back up videos automatically, that jumps to $111.99. That makes it expensive compared to its nearest competitors. 8. SuperDuper!
Like Carbon Copy Cloner, SuperDuper allows you to make bootable clones of your Mac's hard drive to an external disk or disk image.
What makes SuperDuper useful as a backup tool, however, is the Smart Updates feature. This updates the clone at a frequency you specify on an incremental basis: that is, it only copies files that have changes since the last time you backed up. That allows you to keep the clone updated with the minimum of fuss or interruption to your work.
If you use Time Machine for regular backups, SuperDuper can clone and Smart Update Time Machine backups. You can't easily choose which files and folders to back up - the available choices in SuperDuper's menus are 'all files' or all 'user files'. However, you can dig deeper into its options and build your own backup scripts by pointing and clicking.
The latest version of SuperDuper adds support for snapshots on APFS drives. Snapshots are automatically created by macOS High Sierra to save the state of the drive before you install a software update - that way, if something goes wrong with the update, you can roll back to the snapshot.
SuperDuper's Restore section allows you to access those snapshots at the click of a menu and recover your Mac to whichever recent snapshot you choose. And if you use an APFS volume as the destination for your clone, you can use snapshots on the clone, too. That means, for example, if you install an update then Smart Update runs and updates the clone to reflect the software install, you can roll the clone back to just before it updated, if something goes wrong.
SuperDuper is a good option if you already use Time Machine to run regular backups. If you run SuperDuper alongside it, you have a 'belt and braces' backup strategy. If you need to recover individual files, you can use Time Machine, but if disaster strikes and your hard drive is unusable, you have an up-to-date clone ready to boot from, thanks to SuperDuper.
In use, SuperDuper isn't as user-friendly as CarbonCopyCloner - it doesn't, for example, guide you step by step. However, it makes keeping an up-to-date clone of your system reasonably straightforward and does a good job. If you like the idea of the snapshots feature and are comfortable with its interface, this is a good choice."

A lot of video these days is distributed by streaming, which means that viewers need a persistent internet connection.
Streaming has its advantages - among other things it removes the need to store hefty files on your own devices - but there are problems too. If your internet connection dies, your viewing pleasure does too, and most parents of small children will know the agony that results when Hey Duggee starts buffering at a key moment; and there is also the danger that videos will be taken offline in the future and you won't be able to access them at all.
It therefore makes sense to download to your Mac permanent copies (or temporary ones, depending on licensing rights) of the videos you enjoy most online. In this article we outline how to do this, for various popular video sites and services. Parallels Toolbox
Perhaps the easiest way of downloading videos on Mac is to use Parallels Toolbox. This is a software package that combines a wide range of commonly requested functions - including the ability to download videos from Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and other sites, as shown in this video:
You can read about Toolbox's various features, and download a seven-day trial, on the company's website . But we'll look next at a range of methods that use free software or built-in tools. YouTube
The tool we recommend for YouTube is iTubeDownloader . Install this program (you can do so for free) and open it.
You'll find that the software looks just like YouTube, except there's a Download button positioned just to the left of the URL bar at the top of the window. Navigate to the video you want to download and hit this button, name the video, decide where you want to save it and the quality of the file, and confirm by clicking Download again.
This is such a common request that we focus on this task in a separate article: How to download YouTube videos on Mac . Netflix
The method we'd recommend for recording a Netflix film or TV show on a Mac - because the service does not offer a download button when viewed on a Mac, unlike the Windows app - is to use the screen recording feature in QuickTime .
Get your video ready to play, and open QuickTime. Right-click the icon in the dock and choose New Screen Recording.
Click the down arrow in the screen recording window and choose Internal Microphone so you get sound - otherwise the recording will be silent. Now click the record button, and drag to select the video player section of the screen.
(This process is a bit fiddly, and you may find you have to set the video playing before starting the recording, potentially losing the first few seconds. And note that you need to keep quiet while the recording happens or you will record conversation, ambient noises etc too.)
A potentially easier method is to use the free app Apowersoft Mac Screen Recorder. You can download it from the Mac App Store .
This topic too has its own dedicated article: How to download Netflix movies on Mac . iPlayer
The BBC is more amenable to the idea of you downloading its video to a Mac than YouTube and Netflix, although there are time limits placed on the download being playable, and it can only be played back via a first-party app.
You will need to use the BBC iPlayer Downloads app (note that you may have to uninstall a previous version of this app first); once you've got it, you can browse to the programme you want to download and hit the download button. Amazon Video
Downloading Amazon Video content directly to a Mac isn't easy. Amazon allows subscribers to download files (with DRM) to mobile devices and Windows PCs, but not to Mac, so the most effective approach is probably to download on PC, strip off the DRM and transfer to Mac.
If you'd rather not do that - and obviously stripping DRM is fraught with ethical and legal concerns - then you may prefer to use screen recording via QuickTime, as outlined above for Netflix. Open QuickTime, right-click the icon in the dock and select New Screen Recording, turn on the internal microphone, start recording and then do your best to keep quiet. Vimeo
Some Vimeo videos offer downloads without any faff at all, and this is true when watching on Mac just as on Windows. If this feature is enabled there will be a download button below the player, although the versions available will depend on the video creator's membership tier - more info here .
If the creator is not a Plus, Pro or Business member, or if they simply don't want to allow downloads, there won't be a button. In this case you may like to use one of the third-party download sites such as KeepVid - paste in the URL and click Download."

The Amazon Prime membership scheme has been around for a few years now. It started off in the UK with members just getting free next day delivery on eligible items. It was then expanded to include some free Music (about 2 million songs) as well as a selection of free Films and TV programs.
BeforeJuly 2018 , Amazon Prime for Irish residents just included free next day UK delivery and access to some of the Amazon Prime films and TV. Since the start of July 2018 – Amazon Prime members in Ireland can now get FREE priority 2 day delivery to Ireland on all orders (of eligible items) . Not all items sold on Amazon are eligible for Prime – but there are plenty that are.
The option of Free Super Saver delivery on orders over £25 is still available for non Prime members – but this can take 4 to 6 days and sometimes more.
The normal price of Amazon Prime is £7.99 per month or £79.99 per year. As well as the free 2 day delivery to Ireland you get access to Prime Video. Prime Video for Irish members is not as extensive as the UK version – but when we checked in July 2018 there were 3221 films available and 360 TV series.
Prime members can also borrow from thousands of ebook titles from the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library. You also get secure, unlimited photo storage with anywhere access.
The easiest way to find out if it is any good for you – is to sign up for the free 30 day trial If you don’t think it’s worth £7.99 a month you can just turn off the auto renewal before the 30 day trial runs out .
Amazon Music
Sadly – the free “Amazon Prime Music” is not available in Ireland for Amazon Prime members – but the Amazon Music Unlimited option is available in Ireland. It offers 40 million songs including loads of new releases from popular artists. It costs £9.99/month – and you can get a 30 day Free Trial of Amazon Music Unlimited Here
You can stream Amazon Music Unlimited on your phone , Kindle Fire, Tablet , Laptop or PC. You can also download songs to play offline."

These pencils. Love them. Hours and hours of enjoyment for all ages, especially serious artists and adults.
My grand-daughter and friend came to visit for couple weeks and love artwork. I had a set of the “regular” colored pencils that they spent hours enjoying. I decided to look for a higher quality set and decided to purchase this set. (I think there is a smaller and larger set.) I was surprised at the difference in an artist-quality colored pencil and regular colored pencil. The colors are much more vibrant, easy to blend, no stroke markings. No need for pressing hard to get that rich deep color. Fabulous. I use them with the design graph paper I purchased (Amazon) Left review of the paper if you are interested. These pencils will last and because the lead is so thick and more of a waxier pigment there is less risk of breaking. They are in a tin box, not cardboard like crayons. Each pencil is pre-sharpened and has a slot so you can reorganize them if you wanted. This not only protects them during storage but avoids the annoyance of digging through to find the black vs. navy blue! I am sure they would work with coloring books, multitude of art projects and for sure has supported my crochet designs. From a child to an adult these pencils are an asset. Encourages children to develop creativity skills, drawing skills, an artist (whether beginner or professional) to create their art projects, sewing, and even adults that may be confined to a bed or living alone that just want to do something that requires no water, leaves no mess to clean up, and is a fairly cheap source of entertainment. The tin box measures 8”x8”, about 1-1/2” in depth, so it easily fits inside a drawer, hospital bed tray, or back pack. The lid is NOT hinged, but thus far has tightly secured the pencils. No bulky magic markers, broken colored pencils or crayons!"

There are bad takes, and then there’s the take by Forbes contributor Panos Mourdoukoutas (who also serves as Chair of the Department of Economics at Long Island University) that local libraries should be replaced by Amazon book stores .
Among the reasons Mourdoukoutas offers are: libraries don’t have as many public events as they used to because of school auditoriums; people go to places like Starbucks to hang out and work and read now instead of their library; and because technology makes physical books obsolete.

Roland Quandt Samsung is reportedly planning to release a two-in-one charger for its smartphones and the upcoming Galaxy Watch. Packaging for the Wireless Charger Duo has leaked ahead of Samsungâ€™s Unpacked press conference, which will be held at Barclays Center on August 9th.
The Wireless Charger Duo box reveals that itâ€™s capable of charging either two Qi-compatible phones simultaneously or one phone and the Galaxy Watch. Both placement areas support fast wireless charging. The upcoming Note 9 is rumored to feature a 4,000mAh battery, and Samsung has registered a new wireless charge r that could improve upon the already-fast wireless recharge capabilities of recent Galaxy smartphones. Itâ€™s not yet clear whether the Wireless Charger Duo will be capable of that higher output.
After early rumors hinted at Samsung making a return to Googleâ€™s Wear OS with its next smartwatch, thatâ€™s looking less and less likely. The Galaxy Watch is believed to again run the companyâ€™s own Tizen software.
The Wireless Charger Duo comes as Apple continues working away on its AirPower mat, which was first announced at last Septemberâ€™s iPhone event. While two-way chargers are relatively common, Apple has said that AirPower will simultaneously charge three devices â€"" such as an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. In June, Bloomberg reported that Apple has faced â€œa series of technical hurdlesâ€ during the course of AirPowerâ€™s development, such as making sure the charging mat doesnâ€™t overheat and working with its â€œcomplexâ€ circuitry.
Aga in, Samsungâ€™s Wireless Charger Duo just covers two devices at once. The companyâ€™s Icon X earbuds donâ€™t support wireless charging as of yet. But if youâ€™re planning to pick up both the Note 9 and Galaxy Watch, it might prove a convenient (albeit probably very pricey) accessory.

Here We Go Again at the Apollo in Hammersmith, London, Britain
By Rebecca Rubin
LOS ANGELES ( Variety.com ) - In a twist ending straight out of a movie, ""The Equalizer 2"" shot past ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again' to steal the box office crown.
Going into the weekend, it looked like ""Mamma Mia! 2"" would easily debut at No. 1. Final numbers won't come in until Monday, but weekend estimates show Sony's ""The Equalizer"" sequel opened above estimates with $35.8 million when it launched in 3,388 locations, while Universal's highly anticipated follow-up to ""Mamma Mia!"" debuted with $34.4 million from 3,317 screens.
""Equalizer 2,"" the first sequel of Denzel Washington's nearly four-decade long career, launched ahead of its predecessor. 2014's ""The Equalizer"" opened with $35 million and went on to generate $192 million worldwide, including $101 million domestically.
Antoine Fuqua returned to direct ""The Equalizer 2,"" which also stars Pedro Pascal, Ashton Sanders, Melissa Leo, and Bill Pullman. Though it got a head start on the original film, reception has been less enthusiastic for the sequel, which currently holds a tepid 50 percent average on Rotten Tomatoes.
Though ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again"" couldn't dance its way to the top of the domestic box office, its $34 million opening is still a win. The original ""Mamma Mia!"" hit theatres a decade ago with $27 million. It became a box office hit, amassing $615 million worldwide on a $52 million budget. Much like the first film, the sequel will likely be a smash overseas, where Swedish pop group ABBA has a huge following.
Much of the star-studded cast -- including Amanda Seyfried, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard, Colin Firth, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, and Dominic Cooper -- returned for the second film. Lily James made her debut as a the younger version of Meryl Streep's charming and carefree Donna, while living legend Cher also joined the cast. Ol Parker, the screenwriter behind ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"" took over directing duties and penned the script.
The final wide release of the weekend, BH Tilt's ""Unfriended: Dark Web,"" got off to a scary start. The low-budget horror film debuted way below projections with $3.5 million from 1,546 locations. That might not matter, considering the Blumhouse title carries a $1 million price tag. ""Dark Web"" is a standalone sequel to 2015's ""Unfriended."" That film became a cash cow, opening with $15 million and going on to earn $64 million from a $41 million budget.
""The Grudge"" and ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" writer Stephen Susco made his directorial debut with ""Dark Web,"" which features Colin Woodell, Rebecca Rittenhouse, Betty Gabriel, and Andrew Lees.
Among holdovers, ""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" nabbed third place during its second outing. Sony's animated sequel picked up another $23 million from 4,267 locations, bringing its domestic tally to $91 million.
In fourth, Marvel's ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" pocketed $16 million from 3,778 screens in its third frame. In total, the Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily-led superhero blockbuster has made $165 million.
Disney-Pixar's ""Incredibles 2"" rounded out the top five with $11.3 million. In six weeks, the animated sequel has earned a massive $557 million in North America.
Meanwhile, Dwayne Johnson's ""Skyscraper"" continues to struggle in North America. Universal's action adventure dropped 56% in its sophomore weekend, collecting $11 million in 3,822 locations. The studio is hoping for massive returns internationally, where it opens this weekend in China.
At the speciality box office, Lionsgate's ""Blindspotting"" bowed with $332,500 when it opened in 14 theatres. That's a solid per-screen-average of $23,750. Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal co-wrote and star in ""Blindspotting, which debuted to raves at this year's Sundance Film Festival.
Bleecker Street's ""McQueen,"" a documentary chronicling the life of iconic fashion designer Alexander McQueen, landed the top theatre average of the weekend with $24,232. It scored $96,928 when it opened in four theatres.
Another new offering, Amazon Studios' ""Generation Wealth,"" bowed on four screens with $33,602 for a per-theatre-average of $8,401. More From Entertainment "

If you want to see a big name in music play live, you'll normally find yourself having to travel to a big city.
But while many will flock elsewhere, it seems Teesside has always been one step ahead.
Many bands and artists who now sell out stadiums and huge venues have graced us with their presence over the years - making them some of the most iconic gigs our area has ever witnessed.
From Mumford and Sons and James Bay to Arctic Monkeys and Mercury Prize winners Alt-J, these are just a few names that have entertained crowds here over the years - some of them were even free entry.
And many of them were thanks to independent music promoters, The Kids Are Solid Gold's Andy Carr and Phil Carey and Henry Carden of Pay for the Piano, who together are behind Middlesbrough's popular Twisterella festival. Read More Twisterella 2018 line-up revealed - and organisers say it's the best yet
""The Teesside gig-going crowd is amazing,"" said Andy. ""So knowledgeable and so supportive. That's why the bands keep coming here - it's a great gig for them.
""It's absolutely brilliant to help the artists and the fans make a connection and their commitment to our scene gives Henry and I the confidence to do Twisterella and make it what it is.
""Teesside is undoubtedly one of the best places in the UK to catch the best new talent - we have such a great scene here and that's all about the people.""
“I’m very proud to have brought acts such as The 1975, Wolf Alice, Alt-J, Frank Turner, Drenge, Field Music, The Amazons and Fickle Friends to Teesside early in their careers,"" said Henry.
""Part of being a promoter in Middlesbrough is about being ahead of the curve and booking amazing bands before they break - that’s a key component of our ethos with Twisterella, although it’s important to remember that plenty of brilliant bands don’t necessarily go on to become household names.
""Some of the most special gigs I’ve put on have been from bands with passionate, cult fanbases like Brontitde, Beezewax, Stapleton and Lemuria - not to mention Teesside’s very own Cattle & Cane, whose local shows are always incredibly special. It’s also fantastic to see some other excellent local bands developing on a national level at the moment - hopefully we’ll be describing gigs from the likes of Cape Cub, Avalanche Party, Dylan Cartlidge, Llovers and Tom Joshua as iconic in the future.”
So let's take a step back in time and relive some of the iconic moments.

In the fourth quarter, Intelligent Cloud revenue popped 23% to $9.61 billion -- while Azure revenue soared 89% -- a slowdown from 93% in the previous quarter.
The core cloud industry -- which supplies ""the foundation layer of computing and software,"" according to the New York Times -- generated $60 billion in annual revenue and grew 50% in the first quarter of 2018, according to Synergy Research Group.
AWS has posted 70%, 55%, and 43% year-over-year growth in the most recent 12-month periods.
The good news is that the cloud industry as a whole is growing, with a compound annual growth rate of 19% expected through 2020.

I bought an underweight position in Zscaler a few weeks back.
I don't quite understand how the 19% figure Quote: d above goes with Microsoft and Amazon growth figures. Maybe privateClouds are growing slower? Still even 19% is a lot, especially since it should last for several years.
Local PC security is a royal PITA. Now there is a better way, a better mousetrap.
I suspect at some point there will be a Cloud build out bubble just like railroads and fiber optics. But don't think we're there yet and Cloud 1)does not require that much capital 2) can be built in a more incremental fashion. Meanwhile it is the best tech tsunami going."

I’m sure Amazon have the IT know how to sort it.
No response as yet, probably won’t get one either.
BUT if enough of us do it they might get the message they have lost customers due to there own stupidity. Donning tin foil hat and I have always liked a good conspiracy theory. Amazon might not want to play the game because it gives the government an insight into their overall sales from two different perspectives, what comes in and what they sell. If the maths work or don't work the government starts to get a picture of trading and might even give them an insight into company tax if applicable. CHRIS"

I don't know how it is done if you don't have a Kindle.
Use the browser on the tablet to view Amazon and to buy books, then download them onto the tablet.
When you add the Kindle reading app to your tablet, you have to sign in to your Amazon account to associate it with your account. You can then go to your Amazon account and go into your purchased books and select to download to the devices associated with your account. You can then download to your tablet.

Yes a tablet is much more versatile and can do a decent job but the kindle is better for straight books.
The E-ink display is as close to a real book as you can get electronically, can be read in direct sunlight easily, and has a battery that'll last 10 or more times longer than a tablet (probably a lot more).
I have a kindle paper white and I love it, can store more books than I will ever read and I charge it every few months unless I'm actively reading something at the time. Also there's no real need to backup any amazon purchases as they are always in your library,, but it's easy enough to do if you want to - it acts just like a usb storage device when connected to a pc.
The only thing I don't like about the kindle is using the store for buying books - a pc or tablet is better for that. You can also let kindle synch between devices and most book publishers allow a book to be copied to 5 device, so for me that's kinle, tablet, and smartphone. So I can always continue reading on whatever device I have handy."

Retired Detective Bayard Lott hosts the weekly poker games at his home. The group calls themselves the Cold Poker Gang. And they succeed at closing old cases.
Lott's very first homicide case as a brand-new detective had gone cold more than twenty years earlier. But retired Reno detective Julia Rogers, new to the Cold Poker Gang, suggests they look at that case again for personal reasons.
From that simple suggestion spins one of the strangest and most complicated murder mystery puzzles the gang has ever seen.

Book 1 of 3 in Sybil Ingram Victorian Mysteries (3 Book Series)
https://smile.amazon.co m/gp/produ...em_1p_2 _ti
The ghost may be the least of her problems... When vivacious actress Sybil Ingram becomes a widow on her wedding night, her only legacy is a Gothic revival manor in the wilds of the Hudson River Valley. However, the eerie mansion comes with two tenants. One is a hostile ghost. The second, and far worse, is the most insolent, dangerous, maddeningly gorgeous man she's ever met--former violinist Roderick Brooke.
As Sybil and Roderick engage in a battle of wills--and wits--an even greater threat arises: the mysterious queen of local society, Mrs. Lavinia Dove. For reasons that Sybil can't imagine, Mrs. Dove is determined to have Brooke House and Roderick for herself...if necessary, by deadly means.
Nocturne for a Widow is a delightful fusion of gothic romance, mystery, and romantic comedy, perfect for readers who love Victorian women sleuths like Anna Lee Huber's Lady Darby, Penny Richards's Lilly Long, Deanna Raybourn's Lady Julia Grey, and Elizabeth Peters's Amelia Peabody. And be sure not to miss Sybil's continuing adventures in The Last Serenade, A Haunting Reprise, and the short story ""Christmas at Gravesend""!

Trade-war fears have been simmering for months, keeping market gains in check with investors jittery over the prospects of further escalation in tensions having an impact on global economic growth.
The coming week also marks the busiest one of the second-quarter earnings season on Wall Street, with many of the big-name U.S. technology stocks, such as Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon, set to report in the days ahead.
There is also important second-quarter U.S. growth data this week, which is expected to show the economy expanded at its fastest pace in four years in the April-June period.
Meanwhile, on the central bank front, markets are keeping an eye on the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting for further guidance on when the central bank plans to raise interest rates.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets.
1. U.S.-China Trade Tensions
Escalating trade rhetoric will keep investors on their toes as they watch further developments amid an ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China.
President Donald Trump warned on Friday that he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of goods the U.S. imports from China, remarks that threatened to escalate a trade clash with the Asian giant.
The world's two largest economies appeared increasingly headed toward open trade conflict after several rounds of negotiations failed to resolve U.S. complaints over Chinese industrial policies, lack of market access in China and a $375 billion U.S. trade deficit.
Washington has already imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, with another $200 billion being looked at. In return, Beijing levied taxes on the same value of U.S. products.
Additionally, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday that the U.S. is monitoring the recent weakness in China's yuan , and will review whether the currency has been manipulated.
Mnuchin's comments raised the specter of designating China as a currency manipulator for the first time since the early days of the Trump administration in 2017.
The yuan has lost 7.5% of its value against the dollar since the end of the first quarter, prompting speculation that Chinese policymakers are allowing their currency to weaken in order to offset the impact of U.S. trade tariffs, by making their exports more competitive.
2. Trump-Juncker Meeting
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is due meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Wednesday to discuss strained trade relations between the European Union and the United States.
The meeting comes after the U.S. imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum and amid Trump's repeated threats to extend those measures to European cars.
Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said last week he expected Juncker to come with a ""significant"" trade offer.
However, EU officials have sought to lower expectations about what Juncker can achieve and downplayed suggestions that he will arrive with a novel plan to restore good relations.
The bloc previously offered to open its markets wider to U.S. imports, including cars, as part of a reciprocal but limited trade deal, but Washington rebuffed the proposal.
3. Google, Facebook, Amazon Highlight Busy Week Of Earnings
There are about 170 S&P 500 companies and 11 Dow members reporting earnings in what will be the busiest week of the second-quarter earnings season.
Most of the focus will be on the FANG group of stocks. Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reports after Monday's closing bell, followed by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after the bell on Wednesday, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which reports Thursday after the markets close.
Some of other high-profile tech names reporting this week are Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).
Among non-tech names, Boeing (NYSE:BA), McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), 3M (NYSE:MMM), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), UPS (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Ford (NYSE:F), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) are also on the docket for this week."

This 4K monitor is hands-down the best USB-C monitor you can buy to complement your Mac experience. Via one cable, USB-C, you can power your MacBook, transfer video, and use the monitor as a USB hub, with the ability to interface with any peripheral you plug into the UD88's two USB 3.0 ports.
You can calibrate the colors with your MacBook so that you glance back and forth between each screen and have it be seamless and pleasing to the eye. You also have 14 options for layout, so you can view multiple windows simultaneously — run your Apple TV via HDMI while using your MacBook!
As mentioned, the best part of this monitor is its ability to power your MacBook while acting as a display, so that you're not limited by your battery. You can snag it on Amazon for around $600. Acer H277HU Fan Favorite
Acer's slim-bezeled H277HU has a great display that looks as good as its hardware. The golden chin bezel and collar-shaped stand are gorgeous and eye-catching, though not distracting since the bezel around the rest of the screen is minimal.
Like a good USB-C monitor, when it comes to the 2016 MacBook Pro and newer, the H277HU powers your MacBook Pro via USB-C, so you can work all day and night.
This monitor isn't for folks with a wonky setup who need to swivel it around to portrait mode or anything like that, since it can only tilt backward 15 degrees and forward 5. Other than that, it's a great companion to your MacBook, adding a 1440x2560 display, an HDMI port, and a DisplayPort (though you cannot interface with peripherals via your MacBook and the USB-C input). Check it out for around $400. LG Ultrafine 5K Premium Option
I mean, say no more! The LG Ultrafine 5K was developed with Apple, specifically for the 2016 MacBook Pro. This 27-inch IPS panel has a 5120x2880 resolution and pairs perfectly with the new MacBook Pro (at least, the upper-model 13-inch and 15-inch models), offering an 85W charging port and three 5 Gbps USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports.
You can orient this monitor in just about any configuration you like or mount it on a VESA arm using the included VESA cover. This monitor even comes with a Thunderbolt 3 cable!
For more information, check out Rene's review . You can grab this monitor straight from Apple for around $1300. ASUS Designo MX27UC Mid-range Option
For under $550, the ASUS Designo packs a lot into a 27-inch package: a 4K IPS display, two 3W speakers, USB-C PD, a gorgeous frameless design, and DisplayPort, HDMI, as well as the ability to act as a USB hub. For productivity, screen quality, and ports, it's hard to find better in the $500 range.
The Designo also features ASUS' Eye Care, which provides flicker-free backlighting and blue light filtering. Thanks to the in-plane switching, viewing angles are great, at roughly 178 degrees with no color shifting. ASUS ZenScreen Budget Option
The ZenScreen is ASUS's very portable monitor, which has its own USB-C port and offers a great-looking IPS panel. This 15.6-inch screen features ASUS' Eye Car technology to prevent eye fatigue and has flicker-free backlighting and a blue light filter to help keep you productive for longer.
It also has a great display widget that lets you play with advanced settings in order to tweak things just how you like them. The best part? It's only $250! It also weighs about two pounds, so it shouldn't add too much more heft to your laptop bag. In fact, it's so light, one Amazon reviewer did some finagling and basically mounted it atop their MacBook screen. 12.9-inch iPad Pro Double Duty
With a hand USB-C to Lightning cable , you can easily turn your iPad Pro into a monitor for your MacBook or MacBook Pro. It's not a huge monitor, but it'll do in a pinch if you're traveling and can't carry a 27-inch monitor with you everywhere you go. All you need is the Duet Display app ($15), and away you go.
The best part is that, if you're using any of the iWork apps, you can simply continue work you started on your MacBook right on your iPad Pro, so you can put the laptop away when you don't need it and keep working. You basically have two computers in one.
Yes, the iPad Pro has no USB-C port of its own, but that USB-C to Lightning cable makes it work. Grab a Wi-Fi-only version from $649. See at Apple Any more?
Have you found an awesome monitor that features USB-C to use with your Mac? Let us know in the comments below! Updated July 2018: Added the ASUS Designo as our new mid-range pick. Removed the Lenovo ThinkVision X1 due to lack of availability."

The Limousine and bus industry has been using systems like this for many years. https://www.infparts.com/store/index.php?route=product/category&path=411_412_525 You can size it for any area you like. Systems like these do require you to extend your AC lines to the new box. ( This would be your toughest job. ) Your existing compressor should be able to push the extra freon. As an example; Lincoln Town Car's stock Compressor is power full enough to move the freon for up to two of these boxes in stretch limousine and still blow out cold air in front passenger area.
I understand you don't want to add a 12V. unit or inverter but for cooling just the cabover sleeping area ( Not the whole camper. ) I am keeping an eye on the Zero Breeze AC units. Right now the reviews are mixed and the price is too high for me but, if they start selling on Amazon, Wal Mart, Etc. ( With easy returns, if it won't work. ) this might be great for just the sleeping area. The testing indicates that the 12v draw is low enough to be powered by a not too large battery bank. ( You don't need to buy there battery. ) There are a few review videos on Youtube.
I have no affiliations with either of these companies, just food for thought.
Good luck and Safe Travels,"

I Tried an Electronic Vacuum, and It Changed My Life - Like many millennials, cleaning has never been a fun chore or a stress reliever for yours truly. Wiping down windows? Dusting a bookshelf? Doing dishes? No, thank you. It's not for me.
Unfortunately (yet fortunately), I can't get any work done or relax unless my place is spotless and organized . And so, I often spend a considerable amount of time cleaning my apartment. My friends appreciate my spotless space, former roommates adore my cleanliness, and my parents often are confused, ""Why couldn't you have been so tidy growing up?""
Until recently, one thing that I definitely spent too much time on, for way too long, was vacuuming my floors. As an adult who prides herself on being independent and efficient, I found that hauling a huge vacuum around my small space wasn't just annoying, it was torture. Never mind the fact that I was replacing bags and having to store a monstrosity of a machine in my tiny abode (that has very little storage to begin with), I was getting a second workout while I was striding through my bedroom and living room, lunging to reach foreign spaces. Ultimately, a shower would be required after sweating through a simple routine.
After years of this silliness, I got a Samsung POWERbot R7065 Robot Vacuum ($600). Instantly, I boldly decided: I'm never going back to a traditional vacuum. My life was changed. Keep reading to see how a simple change in my cleaning routine enhanced my space, my time, my apartment's sanitation, and even my mood.

Not the car dealership that’s for sure. But we can do that because WE ARE NOT A BUSINESS. we are a public good.

A must have for any motorist is a tyre pump. Having this in the boot of your car can get you out of many a sticky situation. Numerous times I’ve relied on one when a leaky valve was causing problems, or when I’ve been miles away from civilisation and the tyre pressure warning has popped up. It also saves that monthly trip to the garage…those 50p’s add up!
Ring are well known for their quality car maintenance equipment, and I’m still using the same one we reviewed years ago. So what’s this new updated version like?
What is it?
The Ring RAC635 is a 12v cigarette lighter powered compressor to pump tyres up with. It comes with a digital guage that can be pre-set to the correct pressure, once it hits that number the pump will automatically switch off.
Pressure ratings can be switched from PSI, KpA and bar, the pump will also measure the current pressure. At one end there’s a white and red light, for either normal illumination or as an emergency light.
It comes with a set of adapters so you can inflate bikes, footballs and other inflatable items. There’s also a soft carry case to store it in.
The compressor has a max pressure of 80 psi and should inflate a tyre to 35 psi from flat in under three minutes.
What’s it like?
Build quality is great, it feels far more substantial than their older pumps. The cable seems longer too, measuring in at 3.5 metres it allows you to reach to the front and back of even the largest cars with ease.
The plastic does mark easily though, if you allow it to fall over onto tarmac it will mark. So be careful with it if you want to keep it in good nic.
On the end of the connector there’s a small air pressure release button, which is handy when you overfill or find a tyre is already at a higher pressure.
The pump can run with the ignition off or on, it seems to work faster with it on but there’s nothing in the manual to say either/or.
You change the pressure measurement by the small wheel just beneath the backlit dial. Press it to change and then turn it to set the desired level.
Where can I get one?
As always Amazon is your friend, you can currently pick up the RAC635 for around £30 ."

Reboot your router.
Reboot the device itself.
Check for any needed updates to your Fire device.
Make sure it is using wall power and not sponging off the TV's HDMI port or similar. (Not sure if those things can use a USB port for power but use the wall wart regardless.)
Last ditch: Reset it to factory defaults and reregister it and set everything up.
If none of that fixes things, I'd assume it's dead, Jim. New ones are cheap and offer more features and better viewing if I am not mistaken. Talk to Amazon too, they might offer a minor discount on a replacement. That one never hurts to ask about."

Snapcash ended up as a way to pay adult performers for private content over Snapchat, not just a way to split bills with friends. But Snapchat will abandon the peer-to-peer payment space on August 30th. Code buried in Snapchat’s Android app includes a “Snapcash deprecation message” that displays “Snapcash will no longer be available after %s [date]”. Shutting down the feature will bring an end to Snapchat’s four-year partnership with Square to power the feature for sending people money.
Snapcash may have become more of a liability than a utility. With apps like Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, and Square Cash itself, there were plenty of other ways to pay back friends for drinks or Ubers, so Snapcash may have seen low legitimate usage. Meanwhile, a quick Twitter search for “Snapcash” surfaced plenty of offers of erotic content in exchange for payments through the feature. It may have been safer for Snapchat to ditch Snapcash than risk PR problems over its misuse.
TechCrunch tipster Ishan Agarwal provided the below screenshot of Snapchat’s code to TechCrunch. When presented with the code and asked if Snapcash would shut down, a Snapchat spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that it would, explaining: “Yes, we’re discontinuing the Snapcash feature as of August 30, 2018. Snapcash was our first product created in partnership with another company – Square. We’re thankful for all the Snapchatters who used Snapcash for the last four years and for Square’s partnership!” The spokesperson noted that users would be notified in-app and through the support site soon.
Snapcash gave Snapchat a way to get users to connect payment methods to the app. That’s increasingly important as the company aims to become a commerce platforms where you can shop without leaving the app. Having payment info on file is what makes buying things through Snapchat easier than the web and draws brands to use Snapchat storefronts.
We’ll see how Snapchat plans evolve its commerce strategy without this driver. Earlier this month, TechCrunch revealed that Snapchat’s code contained mentions of a project codenamed “eagle” that’s a camera search feature. It was designed to allow users to scan an object or barcode with their Snapchat camera and see product results in Amazon. But since our report, mentions of Amazon have disappeared from the code. It’s unclear what will happen in the future, but camera search could give Snapchat new utility and monetization options.
Snapcash won’t be a part of that future, though. Given Snapchat’s cost-cutting efforts including layoffs , its desperate need to attract and retain advertisers to hit revenue estimates its missed, and its persistent bad rap as a sexting app, it couldn’t afford to support unnecessary features or another scandal. from TechCrunch https://ift.tt/2uW5z86"

The blockchain is in the middle of a major hype cycle at the moment, and that makes it hard for many people to take it seriously, but if you look at the core digital ledger technology, there is tremendous potential to change the way we think about trust in business. Yet these are still extremely early days and there are a number of missing pieces that need to be in place for the blockchain to really take off in the enterprise.
Suffice it to say that it has caught the fancy of major enterprise vendors with the likes of SAP, IBM, Oracle, Microsoft and Amazon all looking at providing some level of Blockchain as a service for customers.
While the level of interest in blockchain remains fluid, a July 2017 survey of 400 large companies by UK firm Juniper Research found 6 in 10 respondents were “either actively considering, or are in the process of, deploying blockchain technology.”
In spite of the growing interest we have seen over the last 12-18 months, blockchain lacks some basic underlying system plumbing, the kind any platform needs to thrive in an enterprise setting. Granted, some companies and the open source community are recognizing this as an opportunity and trying to build it, but many challenges remain. Obstacles to adoption
Even though the blockchain clearly has many possible use cases, some people still have trouble separating it from its digital currency roots, and Joshua McKenty , who helped develop Open Stack while working at NASA and now is head of Cloud Foundry at Pivotal, sees this as a real problem, one that could hold back the progress of blockchain as an enterprise technology.
He believes that right now bitcoin and blockchain are akin to Napster and peer to peer (P2P) technology in the late 90s. When Napster made it easy to share MP3 files illegally on a P2P network, McKenty believes, it set back business usage of P2P for a decade because of the bad connotations associated with the popular use case.
“You couldn’t talk about Napster [and P2P] and have it be a positive conversation. Bitcoin has done that to blockchain. It will take us time to recover what bitcoin has done to get to something that is really useful [with blockchain],” he said. Photo by Spencer Platt/Newsmakers – Getty Images
A recent survey by Deloitte of over 1000 participants in 7 countries found that outside the US in particular this perception held true. “When asked if they believed that blockchain was just “a database for money” with little application outside of financial services, just 18 percent of US respondents agreed with that statement versus 61 percent of respondents in France and the United Kingdom,” the report stated.
Richie Etwaru, founder and CEO at Hu-manity and author of the book, Blockchain Trust Companies sees it as a matter of trust. Companies aren’t used to dealing from a position of trust. In fact, his book argues that the entire contract system exists because of a total lack of it.
“The hurdle [to widespread blockchain adoption in the enterprise] is that those who have traditionally designed or transformed business models in large enterprise settings have systematically and habitually treated trust and transparency as second, sometimes third level characteristics of a business model. The raw material needed are the willingness and executive level alignment and harmonization around the notion that trust and transparency are the next differentiators,” Etwaru explained. The volatility of new technology
Blockchain was originally created as a system to track bitcoin (digital currency) ownership, and it’s still used extensively for that purpose, but a trusted and immutable record has great utility to track virtually anything of value and enforce a set of rules. We have seen companies like po.et trying to use it to enforce content ownership , Hu-manity, which wants to enforce data ownership , and the IBM TrustChain consortium to track the provenance of diamonds from mine to store.

Rob May, who is CEO at Talla and whose company helped launch a blockchain called BotChain to track the authenticity of bots, says finding good use cases could help ultimately determine the technology’s success or failure. “Blockchain has a bunch of different use cases, and they are usually either all lumped together or poorly understood separately,” May said.
He believes that in many instances today, companies don’t understand the advantages of blockchain, which he identifies as immutability, trust and tokenization, the latter of which can help finance blockchain initiatives (but which can also contribute to confusion with digital currency use cases).
“Right now, businesses are missing real blockchain opportunities and instead throwing blockchain in places where it doesn’t belong. For example, they are trying to use it for smart contracts, and that stuff isn’t ready. They also try to use it for cases that require a lot of speed, and again blockchains aren’t ready,” he said.
Finally, he says, if you don’t require immutability, trust and tokenization, you might want to consider a different approach other than blockchain. Please identify yourself
Like any network, identity will be at the core of any blockchain network because it is imperative that you understand whom you are communicating with. Charles Francis, a senior analyst at Accenture says for now blockchains will remain private for the most part, but authentication will become increasingly important as we eventually have blockchain-to-blockchain communications.

“Initially blockchain-to-blockchain connections will be manually set up and you will manage your network in a private model and bad actors will be immediately obvious,” he explained. But he believes that we will require a system in place to ensure we are authentically who we say we are as we move beyond private networks.
Jerry Cuomo, IBM Fellow and VP of Blockchain says that there will come a time when there are multiple networks and we will need to set up systems for them to communicate. “There won’t be one blockchain network to rule them all. It’s a very safe bet. Once you make that statement, these systems need to work together,” he said. “All [the different pieces of networks] need identity and the identity better play across networks. My identity on one network better be the same on another network,” he explained.
For Etwaru it comes back to trust, and a trusted identity would be a natural extension of that. “Transformational blockchain use cases require a network of trading partners to start to operate in a more trusted and transparent way, not just one individual,” he said. Moving toward adoption
All this said, there is still a steady march toward adoption in the enterprise. As Talla’s May says, there may be open questions, but that just represents a big opportunity for smart companies. “If you are interacting with a network instead of a single company, whose throat do you choke when something goes wrong? I think you will see many companies in the blockchain space do what Red Hat did for Linux. Enterprises need consulting help and better frameworks to think about how [blockchain] networks will work, since Ethereum isn’t a product per se in the traditional sense,” he said.
Gil Perez, SVP for products and innovation, as well as head of digital customer initiatives at SAP says he’s seeing companies with real projects in production. “It is beyond just wanting to do something. We’re doing large scale implementations and pilots. For example, we did one in the pharmaceutical industry with over a billion transactions,” he said.
In fact, SAP has a total of 65 companies working on various projects at different stages of progress at the moment. Perez says the next level of adoption will require a way to involve multiple parties, not just a single company, as with a supply chain example, which involves moving goods and paperwork across multiple countries involving many individuals.

He also points out the importance of making sure there is good data because ultimately, if you have bad data in an immutable record, that is going to be a serious problem. That requires the companies involved to come together and agree to a common system to enter and agree upon each piece of information that moves through the system and that is a work in progress.
May sees blockchain technology transforming the way we do business in the future and providing a more standard way of interacting than today’s hodgepodge of vendor approaches.
“Now that blockchain is here, what if we could launch a standard and have shared marketplace by all apps in a space? So as a developer, you write your [application] add-on one time and it works with any [similar application] that supports that standard, and they share one giant marketplace. But how do you get them to share a marketplace? Blockchain and tokens provide decentralization and incentives such that, if you set the right rules, maybe you could do it. That could be transformational,” he said.
As with any new technology, the more it scales the more the tools and adjacent technologies are required. We are still in the early stages of discovering what those are, and before the technology can take off in a big way, we will need more underlying infrastructure in place. If that happens, blockchain could be just as transformational as May suggests. from TechCrunch https://ift.tt/2Lgw2YU"

You're very welcome.
Okay. So you can add additional drives.
A typical HDD is 3.5 inches. So this type of storage device should fit.
You would need a 3.5 inch to 2.5 inch HDD mounting bracket if you are looking at installing 2.5 inch SSDs.
I have used these mounting brackets in the past on HP systems with good results. HP may have modified the HDD cage on newer systems. But the brackets should work.
Amazon has some choices.

In the week ahead, second quarter earnings season will kick into high gear as three of the four members of FANG will report results.
Netflix last week reported earnings that disappointed and shares of the streaming platform fell sharply, and this week all eyes will be on Google parent company Alphabet (reporting Monday), Facebook (reporting Wednesday), and Amazon (reporting Thursday). All three companies will release their results after the market close.
Outside of the FANGs, there will be plenty of earnings action — 174 S&P 500 members are set to report results this week.
Facebook earnings after the market close on Wednesday will be one of the week’s main highlights for investors. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) More Last week, earnings results, Trump’s criticism of the Federal Reserve and continued noise on the trade front all combined to lead the major equity indexes precisely nowhere, though the Nasdaq sits just below a record high after hitting a closing high on Tuesday.
And though another strong quarter for corporate earnings is about to take full flight — data from FactSet indicate that second quarter earnings are on track to rise 20.8% over last year — expect the market discussion to continue to be dominated by trade.
“Trade dominates news headlines and investor discussions,” wrote David Kostin, head of US equity strategy at Goldman Sachs, in a note to clients published Friday.
“Tariffs benefit some domestic industries, but pose a risk to S&P 500 earnings through reduced revenues (lower exports) and weaker margins (higher input costs). Our geographic sales baskets price some bilateral trade risk with China, but not a global trade war.”
Specifically, Kostin notes that soybean prices indicate market expectations for a 25% tariff on U.S. exports to China next year. The firm points out, however, that S&P 500 companies directly derive just 2% of their sales from China, potentially muting the impact of a trade war between the U.S. and China.

“We thought it would come later this year, after more Fed tightening, but Trump apparently has decided to send a signal now. There are implications.”
On Thursday, CNBC published an excerpt from its interview with Trump that ran on the network in full Friday morning. And in this excerpt, we heard Trump discussing his displeasure with the Fed’s past and likely future decisions to raise interest rates. On Friday, Trump added in a twee t that the Fed raising interest rates now, “hurts all that we have done.”
“I’m not thrilled,” Trump said in his interview with CNBC. “Because we go up and every time you go up they want to raise rates again. I don’t really — I am not happy about it. But at the same time I’m letting them do what they feel is best.”

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) More Trump told CNBC that his displeasure with the Fed raising rates reflects how he would feel as a private citizen. But as Valliere wrote Friday, Trump has now put his views on the Fed on the record. There is no going back, both for Trump and for Powell."

Still, she wasn't my buddy's cup of tea and he just ghosted her after a few dates. He also made fun of her for thinking she has a chance with him.

Jump in on the Thunderstone Quest Champion Pledge Giveaway until August 13 here: https://youtu.be/gXp4Yk4aL1k ""This sequel to the Zombicide: Black Plague will bring players back into a world of deadly medieval fantasy, this time filled with infected orcs and goblins who will put survivors to the ultimate test. This green menace is not only stronger than their human counterparts, but they also tend to gather into massive hordes that ambush the survivors when they least expect it.Set in the same medieval era as Black Plague, players will take on the role of Survivors looking to defeat the shuffling, undead menace by any means possible.In Green Horde, up to six players can join the battle for survival. They’ll combine forces and work cooperatively to accomplish their goals, and against all odds, stay alive. Fans of the Zombicide series have become familiar with the Walkers, Runners, Fatties, and Abominations that shuffle around, looking for victims. But the creatures they will face are not just zombie humans, they’re zombie orcs! The Survivors will have to gear up with a wide variety of medieval equipment if they hope to outlast these fearsome foes. Zombie Orcs are stronger than the classic zombie and represent a stiffer challenge to even seasoned undead-hunting veterans.A new challenge for the Survivors is the Horde. It represents a growing group of Orc zombies that are ready to enter the board in an unexpected location and ambush the Survivors. As zombie cards with the Horde symbol are drawn, one extra zombie miniature of the same type is set aside, collectively forming the Horde. They will be locked into place until an “Enter the Horde!” card is drawn, spawning the Horde on the board. Any Survivor caught on their own near this roving menace would best beat a hasty retreat.With such menacing new foes, the Survivors are going to have their hands full dealing with the Green Horde. Luckily, they’ll have some new weapons and spells on their side to help combat the rotting masses. Things like the Lava Burst, the Norse Sword, and the Bone Kukri will all be helpful when hacking through a pack of the undead. Oh, and if they should gather together too tightly, the Survivors can always hit them with the catapult...(did we not mention the catapult?).Zombicide: Green Horde includes ten new challenging quests, featuring some of the toughest scenarios a Survivor has ever had to face. With new terrain, like ledges and water holes, and the ever-present threat of the Green Horde making an appearance, the team will have to plan their routes carefully. Sometimes avoiding trouble is better than facing it head on! Zombicide: Green Horde is the next chapter in the ever-evolving world of Zombicide. There’s no rest for the Survivors if they hope to battle their way to a new hope and a new beginning.""If you like what you see, hit that like button and subscribe to keep on Rolling Solo!

There's too much involved as you could hope for a simple answer.
your domains nameserver need to be correct
the nameserver should have the correct A or AAAA records to let you browse the destination
your google cloud server needs to be configured properly since as I remember getting a route to the outside world is not very beginner-friendly.

How are you trying to get to your photos? Signing in to amazon.com on your computer & going from there? And at exactly what point are you getting the message that you're not signed in? Is it the fact that you're being asked to sign in again that's the problem? Or if you do sign in, once or repeatedly, it still doesn't work? Actually, it wasn't quite clear from your post or the earlier one what was done after initially being asked to sign in again.
There are quite a few places on Amazon where you're asked to sign in again.
Try this route, if it isn't what you're already doing: www.amazon.com/photos (on your computer) & sign in if asked to. Then, is ""Your Photos"" at the top of the menu over on the left? Or are you being asked to sign in again? And what happens when you do?"

Louis D’Amore, the president and founder of the International Institute for Peace Through tourism told eTN: An inspired and motivating article!
What does it mean to be an ambassador of peace? I still remember when I was younger and used to watch with admiration people like Francesco Totti, David Beckham, Keira Knightley and, first of all, my main source of inspiration, the U2’s leader Bono, nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2005. I admired them (and I still admire) for their successes as footballers, musicians or actors, but even more for their example of dedication and integrity that has led them to represent humanitarian organizations (such as UNICEF, for example) by becoming their ambassadors. Recently, the International Institute for Peace through Tourism (IIPT) has awarded me the title of IIPT
Ambassador-at-Large. Beyond happiness for such recognition, a thought immediately jumped in my head: “what now?” To represent an organization such as the IIPT, which promotes values ​​such as those of intercultural dialogue, global understanding as “higher purpose of Tourism”, vehicle for establish contacts and peaceful relations among peoples worldwide, is a great honour but above all a great responsibility. What does an ambassador do, then? Well, my interpretation has matured over time. Without any doubt the easiest definitionion of this role would be: “to spread the IIPT message worldwide through encounters, meeting, projects, events, etc.”. But it is not an exhaustive definition.
When Louis d’Amore, founder of IIPT (and person who I ‘studied’ and admired over the years and for a long time, before meeting him personally in London), appointed me with this role, he gave me something that I jokingly call “the superpower of the ambassador of peace”. What is this? Well, the opportunity and great challenge at the same time of meeting many different people worldwide to spread a positive idea and a message of hope and positiveness to humanity. The powerful and ultimate duty of encouraging and sensitizing people of all ages, status and cultural background about the importance of the participation of each one of us to build together a fair, equal and peaceful society for all of us. “Be the change you want to see in the world”, Ghandi said.
This effort to bring together communities around this topic, to inspire and empower people, regardless of their age, status or work area, touching people’s lives and their hearts, leaving them a message of peace, is therefore a super power. In this context indeed, I still vividly remember the expressions and reactions of the people I met worldwide in the past years.
I remember the enthusiasm and the will of “doing” met in the young people of the associations of Novi Sad, in post-conflict Serbia. I still have in mind the days spent in the Amazon rainforest with a Shuar community, where I found out, among other things, that they also have their own opinion on what is Community Tourism, the opportunities and the threats for them. I remember Leo, tourism operator I met in Ecuador during a conference organised by the Universidad Amazonica, with whom I have had the great opportunity of exchanging some ideas and possible solutions about the possible negative impact of an unsustainable tourism development on indigenous communities living in the jungle.
And I remember the people met in Brazil, far from the usual tourist destinations, thinking about new model of tourism development to promote social development and reduce extreme poverty. And I still feel touched when I think about the enthusiasm of the feedback by the students of the University Roma 3, in Rome, and the satisfaction of Barbara, director of the master in Language of Tourism and intercultural communication. Still, the amazing surprise of the city of Sarajevo, stunning city full of beauty, even though the scars of the tragic siege are still too visible.
I was invited there to talk about tourism and human development to an audience made of hundreds of students, ministers and academics. And there I met wonderful people like Vedran, Miha, Miroslav, Merdzana, Balkans with the desire of create a great future thorugh tourism development for the Balkan region. Still, I keep on my desk the picture of the children of the Daka project, in Bagladesh. And how to forget the experience in Iran, where I founded together with Sassan, Moustafa and many stakeholders in tourism the IIPT Iran Chapter.
What did I learn from these experiences? It looks to me that people, young people but not only, are ready for a change, they are ready to believe in the new power of the individual engagent, they are ready to ‘return human’ to paraphrase and readjust the motto of a great person, Vittorio Arrigoni, Italian activist, journalist and writer assassinated in Gaza in 2011. But they need a signal, someone who shows the way, who in first person goes to present and promote the idea of ​​a global peace and understanding possible also through the enhancement of cultural heritage and development of Tourism, understood as a vehicle for a peaceful encounter between peoples worldwide.
The role of Ambassador of the IIPT has therefore made me rediscover myself as an “academictivist”, academic by profession and activist by vocation. The mission? To show that finally each and every one of us is endowed with the super power to change the world. This is – I think – the task of the IIPT ambassador of Peace through Tourism. It’s a big responsibility. It’s a great job. And I am just getting started. yahoo"

Guest Post by Daisy James We are delighted to welcome Daisy James to our blog today to talk about her latest book Confetti and Confusion.
Adventures in St Lucia
Confetti & Confusion is the second book in the Paradise Cookery School series, set on the spectacular Caribbean island of St Lucia. In the story we re-join Millie and Ella as they showcase a myriad of chocolate-themed recipes for bride-to-be Imogen and her friends in the run up to their glamorous wedding at a luxury resort on the hilltop overlooking the stunning Pitons. It’s a dream come true for Imogen to be getting married in such exotic surroundings and, as a confirmed chocoholic, being able to attend the cookery school is the icing on the three-tiered wedding cake.
By the time the Chocolate & Confetti course starts, Millie has been in St Lucia for two weeks and she’s been so busy that she hasn’t had time to see very much of the island. Zach comes to the rescue and offers to take her on a magical mystery tour of the sights, culminating in an exhilarating treat. Millie isn’t sure about that, but if there’s one thing she’s learnt since meeting Zach it’s that life is for the taking and unless she’s prepared to grab it by the scruff of its neck, she’ll be missing out on all the wonderful things on offer in that part of the world. Little did she know what Zach had up his sleeve – zip-lining!
I had a great time watching the videos of people who had enjoyed the zip wire flights on the slopes above the St Lucian capital of Castries. It looked like fun, but also very scary! The trees were as tall as telegraph poles, and the dense tropical foliage hid a plethora of creatures, insects and bugs. The worst bit for Millie was when she stood on the platform, her toes gripping onto the edge, her stomach churning like an out-of-control washing machine. Fortunately, Zach was there to encourage her to take that first flying leap into the unknown and once she’d landed on the next wooden ledge in the treetops, she was hooked! Exhilarating!
In the interests of research, I decided that I should try out a zip wire ride myself. However, flying through the September air in the UK is a totally different experience to what it would have been in the sun-drenched Caribbean, and I have to admit it was the scariest research I’ve ever done. My heart lodged firmly in my mouth, my knees trembled, and it took a great deal of persuasion for me to jump from the safety of the first platform. Nevertheless, I did it – but I can definitely say that I will not be repeating that particular adventure. I prefer the food-based research any day!
Have you done a zip wire flight? Let me know in the comments.

 July 14, 2018
When one drunken night forever scars three best friends, will they ever find a way to pick up the pieces?
Eaten up with guilt, Ivan Black spends ten years hiding from the world. He retreats to his family forge to wallow in misery. Alone. So lonely his heart aches with it.
Wesley Cook and Rolland Spence have been together since university. They struggle through the physical scars of the accident, building a life in the ruins of their dreams. They find happiness but continue to miss their angry ginger Viking—Ivan.
In all the anger of wasted years, the three men find a way to forge a relationship as hot as the fires in the smithy.
Forged in Flood is a British contemporary M/M/M romance. With heartache, hot men with foul mouths, and plenty of heat, enjoy getting to know Ivan, Wesley, and Roland.
REVIEW FORGED IN FLOOD by Dahlia Donovan is a contemporary, adult, M/M/M erotic, romance story line focusing on three friends-Wesley Cook, Rolland Spence, and Ivan Black- whose lives spiralled out of control ten years earlier following an horrific drunk, driving incident that left each man emotionally and physically scarred but none more so than Ivan Black, the driver of the car that destroyed their lives.
NOTE: FORGED IN FLOOD is an erotic romance story line with M/M/M/ sexual scenarios.
Told from three third person perspectives (Wes, Rolland and Ivan) FORGED IN FLOOD focuses on the rekindling relationship, second chance romance between blacksmith Ivan Black, and podcasters Wesley Cook and Rolland Spence. Ten years earlier, the three university rugby stars, had fallen in love with one another but a night of drinking followed by a drunk driving accident saw Ivan Black run from the men who had stolen his heart. Fast forward to present day wherein a freak rainstorm has threatened to wash away everything Ivan holds dear including the memories he so desperately tries to remember. Enter Wesley Cook and Rolland Spence-Ivan’s former lovers, and the men who refuse to allow their mate to wither and die.
FORGED IN FLOOD is a quick read that follows the on-going volatile and emotional breakdown of Ivan Black as he is unable to come to terms with the guilt from the accident that nearly took their lives. Locked away, far from family and friends, Ivan struggles with his inability to recall the smallest events but does daily battles with the memories of the night that destroyed them all. Wes and Rolland’s continuing efforts to bring Ivan back into the fold is once again met with caustic rejection from the man that they love.
The wonderful secondary and supporting characters include Ivan’s brother George, and his sister Sarah, as well as Sarah’s over-protective husband Remi. The family knows Ivan misses the men that he loves but they too, are unable, to pull Ivan from his self-imposed purgatory.
FORGED IN FLOOD is a story of second chances; of one man’s battle to forgive himself; and two men who are desperate to reconnect with the man that they love The premise engaging and thought-provoking; the characters are dynamic and animated.
Copy supplied for review
Reviewed by Sandy The Blacks of Boscastle had run the forge since before the sixteenth century. All the men and many of the women in his family had been blacksmiths by trade. Ivan had always felt particularly proud to follow in their footsteps. They’d worked through rains, wars, and plagues. I’m not going to be the first to run over a spot of bad weather. There was one major downside to everyone in the village having fled—there were no distractions. Ivan had far too much time on his hands to think. His mind went back in time to an event best left untouched. One dismal night, one massive car crash, and three young lives drastically altered forever. He’d restricted himself to Boscastle and the smithy since then, promising never to take risks ever again. And he hadn’t, not really. His life had become incredibly boring and predictable. Ivan gritted his teeth and slammed down the hammer in his hand to stave off the onslaught of memories. “Sodding rain.” As a young man, Ivan and his two best mates had been the pride of their university. Rugby stars in the making; all three had already signed contracts to turn professional upon graduation. The offers hinged on them staying healthy and keeping their heads in the game. One accident had ruined it for all three of them. All my fucking fault. Of the three young men, Ivan had gotten off easiest as far as long-term issues. He’d suffered a severe concussion along with cuts and bruises. The accident left him with memory problems, a short fuse on his temper, and blindingly painful migraines; his balance had also been greatly affected by the damage to his brain. His mate, Wes, had the injuries that were most visible. His face, hands, and arms had been left covered with scars. He’d also lost the sight in his right eye. The third of their trio, Rolly, had gone through multiple surgeries on his left leg. Even with the best care, it would never be the same. He’d walk with a limp for the rest of his life. Three promising sports careers flushed down the toilet by one foolish mistake. Everyone consoled Ivan by reminding him that any of them could’ve been behind the wheel. They’d driven drunk a thousand times before and gotten lucky each time. Their luck had simply run out. They’d taken their lives (and the lives of anyone else on the road) into their own stupid, drunken hands. The car had flown around a corner on a rain-slicked road and rolled several times before crashing into a tree. For Ivan, his dreams going up in smoke hadn’t been the worst part. Not a day went by where he didn’t regret losing his best mates. Guilt, more than anything, kept him from trying to breach the gap and contact them. He’d hidden himself away in Cornwall to avoid ever having to see either man again. Fucking enough, you fuckwitted moron. Beating yourself up won’t change anything. Sod this sodding rain.
Dahlia Donovan wrote her first romance series after a crazy dream about shifters and damsels in distress. She prefers irreverent humour and unconventional characters. An autistic and occasional hermit, her life wouldn’t be complete without her husband and her massive collection of books and video games.

I wore this dress is a similar way around this time last year, but you have to admit, it's pretty perfect for the hot summer.
Wearing :
Thrifted Hat Old Amazon Dress Target Sandals
I love a good slit in a dress, I think they're flirty, dramatic and perfect for summer, but they can border a little risque for me. I don't know if the slit in this dress is even considered a slit, but I love it regardless.
This is one of those ""it's so hot I don't even want to go outside but have to"" days. Today is a day of errands out in the sun (hence sun hat and 3/4 sleeves) and I'm covered in sunscreen. Let's all hope for leniency from the sun and strength in my sunscreen.
I wanted to keep the outfit loose and comfortable, with the light fabric and the sandals, but I wanted to still keep it within my style, so though the sunhat is for shade and head protection, you know it's because my outfits aren't complete without a headpiece!
Stay cool out there!

We just adopted a large dog who needs a bath but we can’t bathe him until he has a little more trust with us. This filter reduced the smell in the bedroom.
PRO:
- Quiet is not the word. My tinnitus has since age five is louder
- Good filtering
- Nice size and design. It’s not an ugly device
- I trust Swiffer because their other products have revolutionized cleaning
- Four free 30-day filters
CONS:
- I had to put it together. It saved shipping cost but not as much as you would think. It is very easy to put together. A smart toddler could do it
- I wish they had clearer instructions about the internal filter.
- I can’t purchase filters on Amazon. I accidentally tore three of the four filters. My fault but not being able to purchase more is frustrating"

Some caveats:
- It's much larger than the pictures would have you expect.
- It's mostly made of plastic (including the stand which is plastic painted to look a bit more ""metallic"").
- You have to put it together (it snaps and zips - a smart child could do it).
- There is no on/off switch. It runs constantly once plugged in."

The actress, twice the winner of Best Actress Oscars, will voice God in the upcoming Amazon series “Good Omens,” creator Neil Gaiman announced at the show’s San Diego Comic-Con panel on Friday . The comedy/drama series, based on the book by Gaiman and the late author Terry Pratchett, follows an angel and demon, played by Michael Sheen and David Tennant respectively, living on Earth as the apocalypse approaches. The two unlikely friends are having such an enjoyable time among the humans that they’d prefer that the world didn’t end, and do everything they can to keep it from happening. “Good Omens,” which also stars Jon Hamm, Nick Offerman and Miranda Richardson, is set to stream on Amazon in 2019.

Heather Bellini, a Goldman Sachs analyst, estimates earnings per share of $2.23 from Alphabet on revenues of $32.1 billion. Bellini’s is one of the few updated estimates that factors in the record-setting $5.1 billion fine from EU antitrust regulators, who ruled on Wednesday that Google had abused its dominance by forcing device makers to install its search engine and Chrome browser on Android devices. Google, for its part, has said it plans to appeal the ruling.
A drop in the bucket for Alphabet If the penalty ultimately stands, it’s a relatively small amount for Alphabet, which had $102.9 billion in cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities stashed away as of March.
UBS analyst Eric Sheridan does not expect the ruling, which imposes several restrictions on pre-installed Google apps, to significantly slow or deter the download and usage of many Google apps.
Alphabet is set to announce second-quarter earnings on Monday after the markets close. Source: Getty Images More “In the Apple App Store, Google has 9 of the top 50 apps, despite no relationship with the underlying OS,” Sheridan pointed in a report out on Wednesday.
With that in mind, analysts will be looking closely at how Google executives address the penalty on its second-quarter earnings call, given CEO Sundar Pichai’s recent blog post cautioning the decision will “upset the careful balance” Google has struck with its popular Android OS. Pichai’s broad language sparked conversations among tech pundits and analysts that changes could be coming for device makers, third-party app makers and even possibly consumers .
Watch out for Amazon Also worth a look: Google’s stance on the competitive front. In a note published on Friday, Piper Jaffray Senior Research Analyst Michael Olson wrote that he foresees strong, continued growth with Google’s so-called bread and butter — ads via search — but also pointed out Amazon as a growing competitor to watch.
Story Continues In more recent years, Amazon ( AMZN ) has become more aggressive in building out its ads business, which generated nearly $2 billion in ad revenues during the first quarter — up 139% year-over-year. That remains a small amount versus Google’s own advertising-generated revenues, which amounted to $26.6 billion during the company’s own first quarter. But Amazon’s ad business is currently growing at a faster clip, fueled by aggressive sales efforts and the company’s vast troves of retail data.
“From a competitive standpoint, all eyes should be on Amazon as its product search impacts the use case of Google search due to advances in Amazon’s ad business, and as Alexa becomes a gateway to information, but there is room for Google search revenue to continue to grow, especially for intangible products/services that do not lend themselves as readily to ‘Amazonification’ (e.g. insurance),” Olson wrote.
That’s good news for Alphabet and Google — for now.

The blockchain is in the middle of a major hype cycle at the moment, and that makes it hard for many people to take it seriously, but if you look at the core digital ledger technology, there is tremendous potential to change the way we think about trust in business. Yet these are still extremely early days and there are a number of missing pieces that need to be in place for the blockchain to really take off in the enterprise.
Suffice it to say that it has caught the fancy of major enterprise vendors with the likes of SAP, IBM, Oracle, Microsoft and Amazon all looking at providing some level of Blockchain as a service for customers.
While the level of interest in blockchain remains fluid, a July 2017 survey of 400 large companies by UK firm Juniper Research found 6 in 10 respondents were “either actively considering, or are in the process of, deploying blockchain technology.”
In spite of the growing interest we have seen over the last 12-18 months, blockchain lacks some basic underlying system plumbing, the kind any platform needs to thrive in an enterprise setting. Granted, some companies and the open source community are recognizing this as an opportunity and trying to build it, but many challenges remain. Obstacles to adoption
Even though the blockchain clearly has many possible use cases, some people still have trouble separating it from its digital currency roots, and Joshua McKenty , who helped develop Open Stack while working at NASA and now is head of Cloud Foundry at Pivotal, sees this as a real problem, one that could hold back the progress of blockchain as an enterprise technology.
He believes that right now bitcoin and blockchain are akin to Napster and peer to peer (P2P) technology in the late 90s. When Napster made it easy to share MP3 files illegally on a P2P network, McKenty believes, it set back business usage of P2P for a decade because of the bad connotations associated with the popular use case.
“You couldn’t talk about Napster [and P2P] and have it be a positive conversation. Bitcoin has done that to blockchain. It will take us time to recover what bitcoin has done to get to something that is really useful [with blockchain],” he said. Photo by Spencer Platt/Newsmakers – Getty Images
A recent survey by Deloitte of over 1000 participants in 7 countries found that outside the US in particular this perception held true. “When asked if they believed that blockchain was just “a database for money” with little application outside of financial services, just 18 percent of US respondents agreed with that statement versus 61 percent of respondents in France and the United Kingdom,” the report stated.
Richie Etwaru, founder and CEO at Hu-manity and author of the book, Blockchain Trust Companies sees it as a matter of trust. Companies aren’t used to dealing from a position of trust. In fact, his book argues that the entire contract system exists because of a total lack of it.
“The hurdle [to widespread blockchain adoption in the enterprise] is that those who have traditionally designed or transformed business models in large enterprise settings have systematically and habitually treated trust and transparency as second, sometimes third level characteristics of a business model. The raw material needed are the willingness and executive level alignment and harmonization around the notion that trust and transparency are the next differentiators,” Etwaru explained. The volatility of new technology
Blockchain was originally created as a system to track bitcoin (digital currency) ownership, and it’s still used extensively for that purpose, but a trusted and immutable record has great utility to track virtually anything of value and enforce a set of rules. We have seen companies like po.et trying to use it to enforce content ownership , Hu-manity, which wants to enforce data ownership , and the IBM TrustChain consortium to track the provenance of diamonds from mine to store.

Rob May, who is CEO at Talla and whose company helped launch a blockchain called BotChain to track the authenticity of bots, says finding good use cases could help ultimately determine the technology’s success or failure. “Blockchain has a bunch of different use cases, and they are usually either all lumped together or poorly understood separately,” May said.
He believes that in many instances today, companies don’t understand the advantages of blockchain, which he identifies as immutability, trust and tokenization, the latter of which can help finance blockchain initiatives (but which can also contribute to confusion with digital currency use cases).
“Right now, businesses are missing real blockchain opportunities and instead throwing blockchain in places where it doesn’t belong. For example, they are trying to use it for smart contracts, and that stuff isn’t ready. They also try to use it for cases that require a lot of speed, and again blockchains aren’t ready,” he said.
Finally, he says, if you don’t require immutability, trust and tokenization, you might want to consider a different approach other than blockchain. Please identify yourself
Like any network, identity will be at the core of any blockchain network because it is imperative that you understand whom you are communicating with. Charles Francis, a senior analyst at Accenture says for now blockchains will remain private for the most part, but authentication will become increasingly important as we eventually have blockchain-to-blockchain communications. Photo: NicoElNino/Getty Images
“Initially blockchain-to-blockchain connections will be manually set up and you will manage your network in a private model and bad actors will be immediately obvious,” he explained. But he believes that we will require a system in place to ensure we are authentically who we say we are as we move beyond private networks.
Jerry Cuomo, IBM Fellow and VP of Blockchain says that there will come a time when there are multiple networks and we will need to set up systems for them to communicate. “There won’t be one blockchain network to rule them all. It’s a very safe bet. Once you make that statement, these systems need to work together,” he said. “All [the different pieces of networks] need identity and the identity better play across networks. My identity on one network better be the same on another network,” he explained.
For Etwaru it comes back to trust, and a trusted identity would be a natural extension of that. “Transformational blockchain use cases require a network of trading partners to start to operate in a more trusted and transparent way, not just one individual,” he said. Moving toward adoption
All this said, there is still a steady march toward adoption in the enterprise. As Talla’s May says, there may be open questions, but that just represents a big opportunity for smart companies. “If you are interacting with a network instead of a single company, whose throat do you choke when something goes wrong? I think you will see many companies in the blockchain space do what Red Hat did for Linux. Enterprises need consulting help and better frameworks to think about how [blockchain] networks will work, since Ethereum isn’t a product per se in the traditional sense,” he said.
Gil Perez, SVP for products and innovation, as well as head of digital customer initiatives at SAP says he’s seeing companies with real projects in production. “It is beyond just wanting to do something. We’re doing large scale implementations and pilots. For example, we did one in the pharmaceutical industry with over a billion transactions,” he said.
In fact, SAP has a total of 65 companies working on various projects at different stages of progress at the moment. Perez says the next level of adoption will require a way to involve multiple parties, not just a single company, as with a supply chain example, which involves moving goods and paperwork across multiple countries involving many individuals.

He also points out the importance of making sure there is good data because ultimately, if you have bad data in an immutable record, that is going to be a serious problem. That requires the companies involved to come together and agree to a common system to enter and agree upon each piece of information that moves through the system and that is a work in progress.
May sees blockchain technology transforming the way we do business in the future and providing a more standard way of interacting than today’s hodgepodge of vendor approaches.
“Now that blockchain is here, what if we could launch a standard and have shared marketplace by all apps in a space? So as a developer, you write your [application] add-on one time and it works with any [similar application] that supports that standard, and they share one giant marketplace. But how do you get them to share a marketplace? Blockchain and tokens provide decentralization and incentives such that, if you set the right rules, maybe you could do it. That could be transformational,” he said.
As with any new technology, the more it scales the more the tools and adjacent technologies are required. We are still in the early stages of discovering what those are, and before the technology can take off in a big way, we will need more underlying infrastructure in place. If that happens, blockchain could be just as transformational as May suggests."

Alerta Digital ha publicado inicialmente todos y cada uno de los quince retratos de personajes políticos de la reciente historia de España que aparecen en el libro, empezando por el inefable Zapatero, al que el autor dedicó dos artículos distintos, pasando por Soraya, la vicetodo y ahora vicenada, algunos ministros del PP y PSOE, y también los Marqueses de Galapagar.
Galería de tontos contemporáneos destila ironía, mordacidad y socarronería aragonesa, pero únicamente ataca la faceta pública, política, de los personales, nunca el ámbito personal, de su vida privada, que le merece todo respeto. Hemos entrevistado al autor, ex fiscal, profesor universitario en la Universidad de Zaragoza, pero sobre todo, un español de bien y cabal muy comprometido con su tiempo.
-¿Cómo surgió la idea del libro?
El libro surgió de la manera más tonta, escuchando unas declaraciones de esa gran inútil que se llama Celia Villalobos, proponiendo que los trabajadores se jubilaran después de los 70 años, pues ella tenía sesenta y muchos, y estaba como una rosa.
El cinismo, la hipocresía y la cara dura, de cemento armado, de la mayoría de la casta política, me animaron a retratarles ante sus congéneres, a ver si se les cae la cara de vergüenza.
¿Cómo puede decir esta señora que está como una rosa más bien como un cardo borriquero-, si no ha trabajado en su vida, y siempre ha chupado del bote? Se enchufó a los 21 años en la antigua Organización Sindical, y ahí sigue, tetando del dinero público, tan ricamente.
Y como ellas, muchos, miles, posiblemente hasta cientos de miles.
 ¿Cómo has elegido a los personajes?
Pues al albur de los medios de comunicación social, de sus declaraciones y paridas, normalmente buscando siempre el lado más absurdo y estrambótico de las personas.
Generalmente he procurado seleccionar a aquellos que realmente son tontos, y además lo demuestran en sus actuaciones.
Como decía Gracián, un aragonés universal: son tontos todos los que lo parecen, y además la mitad de los que no lo parecen.
En este caso, he procurado incluir solo a los que lo parecen.
-¿El libro va a tener continuidad?
Si Dios quiere, creo que sí, pues el número de tontos es muy elevado, sobre todo en la casta política. Hay quien dice que si los tontos volaran, no veríamos el Sol, y posiblemente es cierto.
En España tenemos la desgracia de sufrir una casta política sin oficio ni beneficio, salvo honrosas excepciones, y que van a la política como el que se hace cura o militar: por vocación, pero también para solucionarse la vida.
En el caso de los políticos, es indignante ver a gente de 40, 50 ó 60 años, que no han trabajado en su vida.
¿Cómo pretenden solucionar los problemas de los demás, si ellos han sido incapaces de solucionar honradamente los suyos propios?
Además, como los políticos lo primero que hacen es ponerse el sueldo más alto de la institución correspondiente, para que no se resienta su dignidad, resulta que viven muchísimo mejor que las personas que se han sacrificado estudiando, haciendo oposiciones, etc.
-¿Cómo ves el futuro de España?
Creo que vamos de Guatemala a Guatepeor. La alianza de partidos extremistas de izquierda con los separatistas catalanes, y los pro etarras vascos, no presagia nada bueno.
El buenismo, por no decir la imbecilidad congénita del PP, tampoco.
Estamos en manos de un gobierno legal, pero ilegítimo, al que nadie ha votado, y que además nunca alcanzarían el poder por las urnas.
Son conscientes de ello, y harán todo lo posible para mantenerse en el poder. ¡Dios quiera que España no acabe como Nicaragua o Venezuela!
-¿Qué crees deben hacer los patriotas e identitarios españoles?
Pues cualquier cosa, menos quedarnos en casa. Tenemos que manifestarnos pacíficamente, acudir a votar, apoyar a partidos que realmente defiendan nuestras ideas, dejar de votar a aquellos que nos han engañado o traicionado, etc. Y, por supuesto, hacer proselitismo entre nuestras amistades, compañeros de estudios, profesión o trabajo, familiares, etc.
Yo, por ejemplo, todos los días reenvío varios artículos de Alerta Digital a amistades, para que puedan leerlos, opinar, etc. Y, de paso conozcan nuestro diario.
Y, para finalizar, quiero agradecer a don Armando Robles su gran e incansable labor dirigiendo el diario, y rodeándose de un nutrido grupo de colaboradores, de gran valía personal e intelectual, y no lo digo por mí, que soy la excepción que confirma la regla.
Un diario es labor de muchos, aunque solo haya una o varias personas en la sala de mando, pero hay que renovar contenidos, estar al día de la actualidad, limar los textos, para evitar andanadas judiciales, a las que los gili progres son tan aficionados, sobre todo cuando no pensamos como ellos.
Agradecemos a nuestro colaborador sus valiosas aportaciones a Alerta Digital, y deseamos que siga al pie del cañón, al igual que nosotros."

From looking at the many negative reviews here, I almost decided to skip this monitor and find something else. I am glad I didn't.
The reason I was looking at this monitor was because I wanted to use it in a dual display setup with my other monitor, a Dell UltraSharp U2515H. The U2515H was the previous model to the U2518D, and I wanted to get something that matched as close as possible. I started out looking for my identical model, but for some reason the only ones I could find were extremely expensive. I started reading reviews on the Dell U2518D, and mostly what I had read was pretty positive like the in-depth review from pcmonitors.info. When I looked at the reviews on this from the Best Buy site, this monitor had many reviews and was close to rating 5/5 stars.
Then when I looked at the reviews here, I started to worry. I almost ordered a Dell 4K monitor for not much more than the price of this one, but I really wanted a 2560x1440 monitor, because I consider the text size to be perfect, and I prefer to run in native resolution, instead of needing to use scaling. I ordered this, and expected the worst.
As soon as I plugged in the monitor and powered it up, I was expecting to see lots of backlight bleed against the black background - but it just wasn't there. In fact this monitor seemed to be slightly better in that regard, than my U2515H. When I booted up the computer and looked at the two monitors side by side, it looked ok, but needed to be tweaked.
For me I found that this monitor had a slight green or blue coloration to it, compared to my U2515H. Once I made the following changes, it matched the U2515H and looked perfect:
Brightness: 60%
Contrast: 75% (default setting)
Preset Mode: Custom Color
Red: 100%
Green: 95%
Blue: 94%
I left everything else at their defaults. With these settings, the display was pretty much identical to my other monitor and a white screen did not have a blue/green tint to it.
I have had this monitor for about a week now, and I am impressed with it. I actually think it is slightly nicer than my U2515H (which always received very high ratings). I don't have any dead pixels and the screen color looks uniform even when looking at an angle.
I docked one star from this monitor because even though it was supposedly color calibrated, it still needed to have changes to its default color settings in order for it to look right. I am very happy with this monitor and I am glad that I purchased it despite the many negative reviews here at Amazon."

The machine revolution is already here, and c-stores are leading the charge.
A Shell station in San Francisco has taken its security to the next level by instituting a robot security guard in the forecourt.
According to a report by The New York Post , the Shell station located at Eighth and Market streets in San Francisco features a robot with four cameras, each pointed in a different direction to record activity from multiple angles. - Advertisement -
The robot moves by rolling around the forecourt at three miles per hour—the same pace as a person walking—while it scans and records its surroundings.
The robot stands five feet tall, three feet wide and weighs 400 pounds, according to The New York Post .
AI Revolution Technologies that can think, learn and adapt will increasingly be part of our lives and sooner rather than later, according to KPMG’s report “Robocalypse: Now? What the ‘Fourth industrial revolution’ means for retail.”
Robotic technology and artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to bring major changes to retail over the coming years.
This September, the 2018 National Advisory Group (NAG) will cover robotics and its potential impact on retail in depth with an all-star panel that will include live robot demonstrations provided by Burlingame Calif.-based Fellow Robots.
The session is titled: “The Machine Revolution: Are Robotics Right for Convenience Stores?”
From robots in the aisle to customer service bots, this session will deal with emerging robotic technology and how this technology will change retail in the future. Already, leading U.S. retailers such as Amazon, Lowe’s, Stop & Shop and McDonald’s are using robotics as a way to manage wage increases and rising training costs.

A little after 9 a.m. CT, July 21, 2018, the Commemorative Air Force’s World War II aircraft, C-47 Bluebonnet Belle N47HL, had an accident at takeoff and caught fire. The accident occurred at Burnet Municipal Airport in Burnet, TX, where it is assigned to the Highland Lakes Squadron.
Thirteen people were on-board the aircraft when the accident occurred. All 13 were able to exit the aircraft without any fatalities. A few suffered injuries, and two are currently being treated at hospitals. The fire was extensive, and the aircraft is a total loss.
The cause of the accident is currently unknown. The CAF is in direct contact with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to support an investigation into this accident.
“We are thankful the aircrew was able to exit the aircraft. Our hearts go out to them and their families as they recover,” says CAF president, Bob Stenevik. “Unfortunately, the historic aircraft will not be able to be restored. Our volunteer members work very hard to keep these aircraft flying, and it is a loss for the entire organization."" About D.O.M. Magazine

Now I'm on my third I realise how different a first baby is. You've got time to indulge in putting your feet up, lots of lie-ins, eating well (with some treats!) and letting friends and family spoil you. When you've got more than one, people aren't so excited and you have no time to even think about being pregnant! I kept a pregnancy calendar with my first (found on Amazon) and it came with various stickers like 'heard the heartbeat'. It's lovely to look back on the day we found out whether we were having a boy or girl and scan pics etc.
Oh and generally, people will give you a lot of advice. Take it on board, but decide what's right for you and your family. I had no idea how competitive and controversial parenting can be (breast/bottle, co-sleep or not, cry it out or gentle sleep training etc). Go with what feels right to you and you won't go far wrong."

Microsoft is capping off a rather impressive year without any major missteps in its final report for its performance in its 2018 fiscal year, posting a quarter that seems to have been largely non-offensive to Wall Street.
In the past year, Microsoft’s stock has gone up more than 40%. In the past two years, it’s nearly doubled. All of this came after something around a decade of that price not really doing anything as Microsoft initially missed major trends like the shift to mobile and the cloud. But since then, new CEO Satya Nadella has turned that around and increased the company’s focused on both, and Azure is now one of the company’s biggest highlights. Microsoft is now an $800 billion company, which while still considerably behind Apple, Amazon and Google, is a considerable high considering the past decade.
In addition, Microsoft passed $100 billion in revenue for a fiscal year for the first time. So, as you might expect, the stock didn’t really do anything. For a company that’s at around $800 billion, that it’s not doing anything poor at this point is likely a good thing. That Microsoft is even in the discussion of being one of the companies chasing a $1 trillion market cap is likely something we wouldn’t have been talking about just three or four years ago.
The company said it generated $30.1 billion in revenue, up 17% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings of $1.13 per share. Analysts were looking for earnings of $1.08 per share on revenue of $29.23 billion.
So, under Nadella, this is more or less a tale of two Microsofts — one squarely pointed at a future of productivity software with an affinity toward cloud and mobile tools (though Windows is obviously still a part of this), and one that was centered around the home PC. Here are a couple highlights from the report: LinkedIn: Microsoft said revenue for LinkedIn increased 37%, with LinkedIn sessions growth of 41%. Microsoft’s professional network was also listed in a bucket of other segments that it attributed to an increased operating expenditures, which also included cloud engineering, and commercial sales capacity. It was also bucketed into a 12% increase in research and development with cloud engineering, as well as a bump in sales and marketing expenses. This all seems pretty normal for a network Microsoft hopes to continue to grow. Azure: Microsoft’s cloud platform continued to drive its server products and cloud services revenue, which increased 26%. The company said Azure’s revenue was up 89% “due to growth from consumed and SaaS revenue.” Once again, Microsoft didn’t break out specifics on its Azure products, though it seems pretty clear that this is one of their primary growth drivers. Office 365 : Office 365 saw commercial revenue growth of 38%, and consumer subscribers increased to 31.4 million. Alongside LinkedIn, Microsoft seems to be assembling a substantial number of subscription SaaS products that offset a shift in its model away from personal computing and into a more cloud-oriented company. GitHub : Nada here in the report. Microsoft earlier this year said it acquired it for a very large sum of money (in stock), but it isn’t talking about it. But bucket it alongside Office 365 and LinkedIn as part of that increasingly large stable of productivity tools for businesses, as Github is one of the most widely-adopted developer tools available."

Received these Betron D-NZ500 yesterday. And have been giving them a shot.
For £10 They come in the most extraordinary package, a really tasty brown velvet hinged box of high quality, 7 sets of tips including foam, a shirt clip and drawstring pouch.
It's virtually set out like the old Etymotic ER4, which is why I thought I'd give them a go.
They are gold in colour and resemble an etymotic for sure , seem well made with a rubber like covered cable but with very low microphonics. But you have a shirt clip anyway so no problem.
No cable synch but it really isn't a huge deal. As the cable is actually nice.
Isolation is excellent with the grey tips with red bores
Sounds wise well they certainly aren't etymotic quality, but actually they really are surprisingly very very good.
Actually these have a very Shure 535 presentation, especially in sub bass and mids, the mids actually are quite buttery!
The bass doesn't really go that deep, it's mostly sub Not quite as refined as the shure but hey £10.
Treble is well Shure 530 ish, It's there but not as rolled off however it does sound like them.
After listening to them last night and this morning I'm very impressed with them indeed, great for Rock, fusion and jazz. A very pleasing shure like sound, sorry but every time I've put them in I instantly think 535 lol
Very enjoyable earphones indeed. Lovely bouncy bass, butter like mids and a nice treble
They aren't detail monsters by any means and they aren't the most refined out there but having said that they really are a pleasure to listen to.
Plus the the box and accessories make these a brilliant bargain.
Very happy. Click to expand... I bought those last March - £8 lightning deal. I immediately recognized that they were excellent...and as you said enjoyable. I am finding more and more that Betrons are excellent iems. Having never seen nor heard an etymotic, I had no idea that they resemble those. I have never heard a Shure either.
I have eight Betrons!"

No these are not watermelon seeds that are giant, they are seeds that make giant watermelons! And I'm talking giant! As in up to 200 lbs giant! Or at least that's what this seller on Amazon is claiming. Supposedly you can plant these magical seeds in the ground, and after 90 days for maturity you'll have giant watermelons spilling out of the ground.
In reality you'll have to read through the reviews on Amazon to see if you're willing to take the gamble to see if they work. It seems half the people can't get them to grow anything, while others do seem to get some extra-large watermelons to grow from their garden.
With the purchase of the giant watermelon seeds, you'll get a total of 10 seeds, and they'll supposedly produce huge watermelons with extremely flavorful, crisp, bright red watermelon flesh that could feed a family of 12! They also claim the giant watermelon rind is striped and resistant to bruising.
If you can get one of these giant watermelons to grow in your yard, you'll surely impress your neighbors, friends, and family into thinking you're some sort of magical gardener! Plus you might even be able to enter the huge watermelon into a watermelon growing contest."

Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters More Take a walk through King’s Cross station most days of the week, and you will see a crowd of people gathered among the usual rush of commuters and weary travellers awaiting the umpteenth delayed London-to-Leeds service.
This isn’t the complaints queue for cancellations. These people have travelled from further afield than Bradford – from South Korea, the US , France and Germany – to wait for a train that doesn’t even exist.
Having started as a humble homage to the Harry Potter books, the gap between platforms nine and 10has developed into one of the biggest tourist attractions in the capital. Alongside the plaque marking the fictional platform 9 ¾ and the luggage trolley stuck halfway into the wall, there is a gift shop and professional photographer. There are always queues. This is a lucrative combination of capitalism and the human imagination.
As a metaphor for the future of the British economy, the boy wizard created by JK Rowling and the queues for the Hogwarts Express are apt.
Advanced economies around the world are increasingly moving away from producing tangible goods to become more adept at creating intangible value – through branding, intellectual property and computer software – of the kind exemplified by the Harry Potter franchise. Once upon a time wealth was defined by physical assets. Nowadays companies like Amazon and Google rank as among the most valuable in the world despite making very little of physical worth.
Herein lies the problem for Britain. Besides figuring out how to tax the seemingly magical profits of the internet firms, the rise of the intangible economy poses the UK with two tough questions.
First, there is the problem with measurement. At the end of next month, Jonathan Haskel, an expert in intangible economics at Imperial College, will become a member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee to help Threadneedle Street better understand the challenges ahead.
Answering questions from the Treasury select committee last month before his appointment, he used the example of Harry Potter as a “bundle of intangible assets”, telling MPs: “It is the creative copyright from the book. It is the software that goes into the movie. It is the branding. It is the set design that gives you all these gothic decorations that you see in the film, in the play and that kind of thing. There is a whole bundle of intangible assets. The economy is moving much more in that direction.”
Haskel has written a book on the subject, Capitalism Without Capital, to explain the challenges. Principal among them is measuring the gains for the economy from things that cannot be held firmly by hand.
Google’s chief economist, Hal Varian, takes this further, pointing out that about 80bn photographs were taken all over the world at the turn of the millennium, at a cost of approximately 50 cents (38p) each using a traditional camera. By 2015, smartphones enabled as many as 1.6tn photographs to be taken for free. While GDP – the universal economic measure of expenditure, production and earnings – should rise with economic progress, it fails to capture this shift. The loss in terms of foregone production and sales of cameras actually means GDP goes the other way.
The economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Felix Eggers and Avinash Gannamaneni have tried to measure the value of free digital goods and have come up with staggering results. Overall, they say, our use of search engines, email and other products like social media and digital maps should cost as much as $25,700 (£19,560) a year per typical internet user if it was not free. This is yet more value missing in action from the modern economy.
Some monetary policy hawks argue higher interest rates are required because the economy may be performing better than the figures, missing these elements, appear to suggest. But they would be wrong to believe Britain is perfectly placed to benefit from the intangible economy. There are many things holding back its development. Which brings us to the second point in the debate about intangibles: finance.
Like the Dementors in Rowling’s books, the banking industry acts to sap the vitality of the intangible economy. Most economists agree the big thing needed in Britain is greater levels of investment, particularly as Brexit discourages firms from spending . But there are significant barriers for borrowing to invest in intangible assets from the current financial setup."

IT’S easily the most frustrating part of any visit to Kmart.
And while it’s a pet peeve of the discount department store’s loyal customer base, the insanely popular chain is sticking to its guns when it comes to the controversial new layout which has seen cash registers moved from the entrance into the middle of stores.
While the first Kmart store to undergo the drastic change did so in 2012, the roll out really stepped up in 2016.

• ‘Boom, instant pay rise’: Get a free $26k
• Bizarre Trump lie undone by one picture
And today, around 165 stores in Australia and New Zealand have already been converted, out of a total of about 228 shops across the two countries.
But it’s a move that has frustrated many customers, who claim the new format is confusing and chaotic.

— Dan (@AUiTao) June 27, 2018 @Kmart_Australia I know that you are following the layout of other stores but for some reason it works better in smaller stores like Richmond and moonee ponds than it does at Campbellfield and APW. 😔🛒💔
— stefcas (@StefCas33) June 23, 2018 It’s a sentiment that was echoed by hundreds of Kmart shoppers polled about the change by news.com.au late last year, with many describing it as “disorienting” and complaining about being “made to feel like a shoplifter” when leaving the store, with security guards now checking customers’ receipts as they left.
“The pat down drives me insane,” one shopper said, while another dubbed the process “inefficient”.
Queensland University of Technology retail expert Dr Gary Mortimer agrees, and said he struggled to understand why the chain was persisting with the rollout in the face of overwhelming customer backlash.
“The placement of the registers in the centre of the store was a part of a redesign to create ‘worlds’ of merchandise — when they redesigned the new-format store, they’ve put things like home furnishings together, stationery and craft together and they’ve mixed children’s toys, footwear and clothing together to create zones within the store,” he said.
“As part of that decision they’ve also placed the registers in the heart of stores rather than around the perimeter which is really quite different to any other retailer in Australia.
“Shoppers have really struggled to comprehend this new location despite having them in place for several years now, because commonly you walk in, select goods and pay on exit.”
Dr Mortimer said Kmart may have initially taken a gamble by moving the registers, and that it might be too costly to reverse.
“I would imagine the cost to move the point of sale terminals to the front of stores again would be significant and they’d have to move all of their data and cabling and cash tubes, so I suspect they’ve had a store redesign in mind, they’ve rolled it out and it may be the case where they’ve committed to it in so many stores and that’s why they haven’t retracted,” he said.

“But it is surprising that despite shoppers’ apparent continued frustration and confusion in relation to register locations they haven’t made that move to the front of stores.”
Nevertheless, Kmart and Target’s senior manager corporate affairs Steve Mann insisted the decision had been a success, and was here to stay.
“The plans are still there and it’s going well. Any new store has the new layout and we’re slowly converting old stores to the new design bit by bit,” he said.
“It’s been in place for quite a while now and people are used to it because there are a lot of similar stores that have that layout as well, so people are pretty used to seeing registers in the middle; it’s very familiar to people.
“When it changed over initially it was very different … but it’s been a couple of years now.”
While many have speculated that the design change was a bid to crack down on shoplifting or manipulate shoppers into buying more, Mr Mann said it all came down to aesthetics.
But he said moving cash registers to the middle of shops was a trend that was happening right across the retail sector.
“The rationale is we want the entrance of the stores to be free from clutter and inviting for people, showing off our products rather than registers,” he said.
“JB Hi-Fi and a lot of others have the same model of showcasing great products and inviting people in.
“We’ve noticed the layout is more open now and more spacious without having the registers up at the front part, which can get congested during busy times of the year like Christmas.”

Innovator CyberAgent’s Susumu Fujita | H.E.R.O. HeartWare | 23 July 2018 (Issue 11)
“My management style is tolerating most of the time, to endure. About 95% of winning is more about enduring, amongst various things. The remaining 5% is when you make an offense… The work of advancing each piece peacefully without losing sight of the original purpose is perseverance,” said Susumu Fujita , founder and CEO of CyberAgent (TSE: 4751), the innovative internet ad, gaming and media platform in Japan with a market value of over US$7.5 billion commanding over 20% share of the smartphone ad and 23% of the video ad market, and powering the popular and unique Ameba social media & virtual community platform with over 3 billion monthly page views, Japan’s leading dating app ‘tapple’ with over 3 million subscribers and the leading subscription-based digital music streaming service AWA, as well as the innovative internet television AbemaTV with over 11 million monthly active users.
“After listing for 18 years, we have repeatedly made a lot of upfront investment. We have invested in Ameba blogs, smartphone & video advertisements in advance, but thanks to that, we have been able to update our record high profits in existing business and will continue active investment in AbemaTV while the existing business is doing good. To start a new thing, anxiety and disturbance will occur. However, it is the job and mission of management to believe in yourself,” commented CEO Fujita-san on how CyberAgent is able to keep innovating, stay relevant and thrive by investing in new businesses for future growth, compounding 100X since January 2001 to over US$7.5 billion in market cap.
On how he copes with the stress of his work, CEO Fujita-san shared a profound inner thought, “‘If it is not depression, it is not a job’, there may be some people who wonder about this catchphrase by Goethe, since ‘if you enjoy your work, life is pleasant’. But it seems to be the case that the work gets bigger when you twist your body to the more depressed one, to think about doing the difficult work. To do that, I must take a postponement of my head and I must feel like bleeding blood. But I have thought that this is the correct attitude toward work. So, if you suffer, the pleasure after doing your work increases proportionally. I think that is the real pleasure of work.” Fujita-san added, “What is important is the strength of the heart in adversity. In order to grow, we need a strong heart that does not move even if what people say around me is not positive. It is different from the heat of the heart. The heat ends with a short lived span but strength is not so. It is something that can be trained over time. We also experienced various ups and downs such as the collapse of the Internet bubble, the collapse of the stock price, the major turnaround in the business. I was forced to make a decision each time. I do not think that the decision power is smart or bad, I think whether the mind is strong or weak. For being disturbed by the numbers in front of me or being swept away by the surrounding opinion, my heart is weak. Conversely, if you are strong, you can push through the path you believe is correct.”
Another emerging H.E.R.O. innovator, Daisuke Sekine , founder and CEO of OpenDoor (TSE: 3926), shared his insights on how he has been able to innovate, stay relevant and stand out amongst bigger rivals from Kakaku.com to trivago and TripAdvisor to build Travelko to become Japan’s leading one-stop travel comparison and reservation site with a market value of US$650 million supported by over 4 million monthly active users, especially enjoying strong loyal support from the F1 layer, or female of 20-34 years of age who are said to be the most discerning and sensitive to price and richness of content/products as they find compellingness, convenience, and accuracy in Travelko’s most comprehensive range of travel-related services instead of just hotel or airline tickets like other competing sites, from domestic (~25,000) and international (~800,000) hotels and air tickets (~500 airlines) to domestic (~300,000) and overseas (~700,000) packaged and dynamic tours, day trips, bus tours, express bus and night bus, car rental, overseas Wi-Fi rental, etc.
CEO Sekine also shared the meaning and purpose of what his company stand for, “The origin of our company name OpenDoor was always from my strong desire to open the door to continue the challenge, seeking the possibilities of a new field at all times. Do not be afraid of new challenges, continue to contribute to society’s richness, joy, and the future with constant innovation. Since our establishment in April 1997, we have steadily expanded our business and steadily continue to grow, but we believe that the root of this is the result of thoroughly looking at the customer’s perspective and pursuing quality without compromise. Travelko is the pillar of our business and it is widely used as the largest travel comparison site in Japan, endorsed by the largest number of customers who use it and the largest number of travel-related companies published on the website. We open doors and will respond quickly to customer’s needs through the Internet business in a wide range of fields and strive to maximize customer satisfaction. For that purpose, we will continue to challenge the realization of the business as the No.1 from the endorsement of both customers and markets, constantly seeking the possibilities of a new field with a venture spirit and we will continue to challenge ourselves further.”

HeartWare: Weekly Asia Tech News with brief highlights of the inspiring entrepreneurial stories of tech leaders in Asia whom we have been monitoring over the past decade in our broader watchlist of over 200 listed Asian tech companies and our focused portfolio of 40 HERO Innovators who reveal their problems and successes behind building the company. In Issue 9, we have:
(1) Susumu Fujita 藤田晋, co-founder & CEO of CyberAgent Inc サイバーエージェント (TSE: 4751, market cap US$7,578m), one of Japan’s leading internet ad, gaming & media platforms with three pillars of businesses: media (Ameba blog & social media platform which includes the innovative Ameba Pigg, a virtual community in which users can customize an avatar to socialize with people around the world and decorate their own rooms with virtual currencies; Japan’s leading dating app ‘tapple’ with over 3 million members; subscription-based digital music streaming service AWA in a 50-50 joint venture with Avex; internet TV AbemaTV in a 60-40 joint venture with Asahi TV), internet advertising agency and smartphone game (e.g. Cygame), as well as an investment development business CyberAgent Ventures with a proven successful track record to invest in, nurture and list start-ups. CyberAgent commands 20.6% share in the smartphone ad market and 23.4% share in the video ad market in Japan. AbemaTV was started in Apr 2016 and now has 20 channels, including original live programming, and monthly active users (MAU) which exceeded 11 million and total viewing hours which exceeded 50.72 hours. CyberAgent was founded in 1988 by Susumu Fujita and Yusuke Hidaka in 1998 and is headquartered in Tokyo;
(2) Daisuke Sekine 関根大介, founder & CEO of OpenDoor Inc オープンドア (TSE: 3926, market cap US$654m), which operates Travelko ( www.tour.ne.jp ), Japan’s leading one-stop travel comparison and reservation site with the biggest range of travel-related services from domestic and international hotels and air tickets to packaged and dynamic tours, day trips, bus tours, express bus and night bus, car rental, overseas Wi-Fi rental, etc. Travelko commands the highest brand recognition rate (Feb 2018: 30% vs 13.6% in Sept 2016) with its catchphrase “Let’s find the lowest price of your trip” and over 4 million monthly users (vs 3.05 million in Mar 2016 and 2.2 million in Mar 2015), especially enjoying strong loyal support from the F1 layer, or female of 20-34 years of age, who are said to be most discerning and sensitive to price and content. Travelko also covers all the information requested by the user concerning the trip by posting local information by local professionals such as tour guides and informational travel blog. OpenDoor also operates TRAVELKO ( www.travelko.com ), a multi-language travel comparison meta-site (English, Chinese, Korean) aimed overseas and inbound markets. It is also useful for overseas residents to search for inbound trips to Japan, as well as to search for trips to their own country and other countries. Travelko is able to not only survive but importantly stand out as the leader amongst the hyper-competitive market with rapid changes by distinguishing itself through (1) the largest number of registered domestic and overseas travel agencies and booking sites at over 500 (vs 300 In 2016) to bring about the most competitive and lowest prices for users; (2) providing the most comprehensive range of travel-related services instead of just hotel or airline tickets like other competing sites: ~25,000 domestic hotels, ~800,000 overseas hotels, ~500 airlines, ~700,000 overseas tour, ~300,000 domestic tour, etc; and (3) the successful transformation to the pay-per-use performance fee model (over 90% of sales are pay-per-use income). OpenDoor was founded in 1997 by Daisuke Sekine and is headquartered in Tokyo.
We now live in an exponential world, and as the Baupost chief and super value investor Seth Klarman warns, disruption is accelerating “exponentially” and value investing has evolved. The paradigm shift to avoid the cheap-gets-cheaper “value traps” investment mistakes, to keep staying curious & humble, and to keep learning & adapting, has never been more critical for value investors. We believe tech-focused innovators with non-linear exponential growth potential are the most relevant multi-year investment trend and opportunity. There is a structural break in data in the market’s multi-year appraisal of “exponential innovators”, the type of business models that can compete and thrive in an exponential world.
Yet we do not want to chase the highly popular megacap tech stocks, or fall for the “Next-Big-Thing” trap by overpaying for “growth”, or by chasing to invest in fads, me-too imitators, or even in seemingly cutting-edge technologies without the ability to monetize and generate recurring revenue with a sustainable and scalable business model, and we want to know how to distinguish between the true innovators and the swarming imitators. We see a distinct opportunity in under-the-radar Asian SMID-cap tech stocks with unique scalable business models run by high-integrity entrepreneurs with a higher purpose in solving high-value problems.
As the only Asian SMID-cap tech-focused listed equities fund in the industry, we believe we are uniquely positioned as a distinctive and alternative investment strategy for both institutional and individual investors who seek to capture long-term investment returns created by disruptive forces and innovation without herding or crowding to invest in the highly popular megacap tech stocks, and also provide capital allocation benefit to investors in building optionality in their overall investment portfolio.
H.E.R.O. stands for “Honorable. Exponential. Resilient. Organization.” and is operationalized into a unique, systematic 4-step investment process to separate the winners and losers. The H.E.R.O. HeartWare Weekly highlights interesting tech news and listed Asian emerging tech innovators with unique and scalable wide-moat business models to keep yourself well-informed about disruptive forces and innovation, new technologies and new business models coming up, and the companies that ride on and benefit from them in some of the most promising areas of the economy in Asia as part of our thought leadership for our ARCHEA Asia HERO Innovators Fund to add value to our clients and the community.
Some of the HERO Innovators in the focused portfolio include the largest online-to-offline pet insurance company in Japan with over 60% domestic share of the growing pet insurance market with over 636,000 policies in force generating over 98% sticky recurring revenue income & cashflow (Japanese households own 20m pets and only 1.3m or 6.3% were insured vs 22% of the 15m pets were insured in UK), and is a tech innovator with services that include allowing insurance claims to be made via LINE in just three minutes, an industry first, enabled by its powerful database & analytical prowess of more than 10 million insurance claims tied to illnesses and accident that allow the company to propose preventive measures by examining how animals become sick and how accidents occur. This highly profitable online pet insurance with a healthy net-cash balance sheet founded by an inspiring and down-to-earth entrepreneur with an agricultural economics background who started his career at a top insurance company is an archetypal H.E.R.O. Innovator.
Beyond Moat: Catapult Your Business to Exponential Value Creation | From Economic Moat to Catapult Analysis of Business Model Quality to Discover Tech Innovators
The Catapult is our analytical framework within the 4-step H.E.R.O. investment process to complement and rejuvenate the economic moat analysis to view the value creation process afresh and continually discover innovators creating, enabling and capturing new demand (vs exploiting existing demand) with exponential non-linear growth potential and value creation. The Catapult exponential projectile of the 4Cs are systematic observations and leading-indicator questions you can ask to analyze and assess the business models of exponential innovators.
(1) “Curiosity” Edge
Does the company create or generate curiosity and discovery amongst the users and customers for its products and services? Is there a riveting effect that leads to engagement? User-centric customized recommendations, engagement depth in time invested, etc Examples: Amazon Prime, Netflix, Tencent Music, Kakao M (KOSDAQ: 016170), Syuppin (TSE: 3179), etc
(2) “Community” Edge
Does the company build a community/platform/environment where customers/users/members can connect and interact repeatedly with one another to forge longer-term relationship and emotional connections Vs mere transactions-based exchange? User-generated content (UGC) in reviews; ratings to foster trust, credibility, collaboration and celebration in the many-to-many interaction; feedback loop to improve; brand advocates/ raving fans/ whale curve; is there social capital capacity to expand into complementary products and services to serve the community Watch out for unusual capitalization of customer acquisition costs (CAC), goodwill in balance sheet Examples: Apple iOS, Benefit One (TSE: 2412), Itokuro (TSE: 6049), Bandai Namco (TSE: 7832), CyberAgent (TSE: 4751), etc
(3) “Compellingness-Craftsmanship” Edge
Does the company create and deliver products, services or solutions with compellingness and craftsmanship? Process IP, intangible know-how/system and mastery to bring about comfort, convenience, “customized” pain-killing solutions to customers Compellingness (external) combined with Craftsmanship (internal) Craftsmanship: Think Steve Jobs shared the story of how he was inspired by his dad who taught the young Jobs that it was important to craft the back of cabinets and fences properly, even though they were hidden. “He loved doing things right. He even cared about the look of the parts you couldn’t see.” Examples: Amazon, Microsoft, MISUMI Group (TSE: 9962), MonotaRO (TSE: 3064), Synchro Food (TSE: 3963), Koh Young Technology (KOSDAQ: 098460), etc
(4) “Circumspection” Edge
Does the company deliver/enable circumspection and acumen/insights/intelligence for the customers with usable framework of knowledge, tools and analytics to bring useful insights to help them think better and make better decisions? Examples: Google, M3 (TSE: 2413), e-Guardian (TSE: 6050), MonotaRO (TSE: 3064), Appen (ASX: APX), Vista Group (NZSE: VGL), Supermap (SZSE: 300036), etc
Hope you find the weekly report to be useful and insightful. Please give us your candid feedback and harshest criticisms so that we can improve further to serve you better. Besides the BATTSS (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, TSMC, Softbank, Samsung), do also tell us which Asian tech entrepreneurs & CEOs whom you admire and respect and why – we will endeavor to do up profiles of them for sharing with the community.

America’s high-tech colossi dominate the globe: Amazon, Uber, Apple, Microsoft, Lyft, Intel, Facebook, Google , Instagram, eBay, Twitter, Lyft and others were all made in America. Europe’s tech companies, by contrast, are puny. Only Spotify, a Swedish music-streaming app, has made much of splash globally.
The reasons for America’s tech dominance are hardly secrets — a healthy respect and appreciation of entrepreneurship, higher education that attracts students from all over the world, and abundant access to venture capital reserves. Above all, the political culture, most of the time, promotes business rather than punishes it.
It’s different in the Old World. Authorities there tend to see successful businesses as a threat, a problem to be tamed, or at the very least sources of revenue to be tapped. More so if those businesses are native to America.
Only last week the European Union levied a multibillion-dollar fine against California-based Google . The EU ordered Google to pony up 4.34 billion Euros, about $5.1 billion at current exchange rates. There’s an unrelated $2.7 billion fine against Google last year. The EU has fined Microsoft, Facebook and Intel on several occasions. The $5.1 billion fine against Google is the largest EU fine so far.
The EU accuses Google of unfairly exploiting its ownership of the Android operating system for smartphones in a way that hampers competition with other search engines. About 80 percent of the world’s smartphones run Android, which default to Google as their search engine of choice. Android is effectively free; Google makes up for that by directing users to its search engine and other services.
The EU sees something sinister in that arrangement. “ Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine,” says the EU ’s antitrust chief. “These practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere.”
Google is appealing, naturally, but in the meantime it must deposit the $5.1 billion in an escrow account. The EU ordered Google to no longer tie the Android operating system to Google search and to Chrome, Google ’s web browser. U.S. and European antitrust authorities tend to take a different approach to the issue. American authorities look at what benefits consumers, the Europeans to what benefits governments. There’s no doubt that services like Android, which provide enormous benefits at no cost, have been a boon to Google . Europeans, however, look at how current arrangements affect would-be competitors.
Those competitors have been lagging, badly, behind Google . Declan McCullagh observes in Reason magazine that what may have began as a reasonable difference in emphasis “now appears to have morphed into naked European protectionism. The economics are simple: European firms have fallen behind their American counterparts to the point that not one European firm appears in the list of top 20 internet companies ranked by market capitalization. Any aggressive approach toward antitrust enforcement of mobile or online business practices will, not-so-coincidentally, handicap Silicon Valley companies to the advantage of smaller European rivals.” Just a coincidence, of course. Europeans, so outraged at Donald Trump’s trade wars, are engaging in one of their own.

By Ann Brown
Bernie Sanders is taking on overpaid CEOs to address the issue of underpaid workers at companies like Disney, Amazon, and American Airlines.
“Sanders is calling out other major companies, too. He recently held a town hall event to discuss “something that is never discussed,” with workers from Amazon, American Airlines, Walmart, McDonald’s, as well as Disney,” AOL reported.
But is Sanders, who is expected to put his hat in the ring again for the 2020 presidential election, right about American Airlines? Is America worse than the other carriers when it comes to staff salaries?
Sanders posted on social media recently: “Last year American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits. Its CEO Doug Parker is on track to make $31 million this year.
They need to explain why 27 percent of workers at their subsidiary Envoy Air said they must accept food stamps and other public assistance to make ends meet, and some must borrow from retirement accounts and even sell blood to get by.”
What makes American airlines standout is that it is the world’s largest carrier–and successful. But its staff says the can not Click here to read entire article

RELEASE DATE: Monday, July 23, 2018 Synopsis : It was just a typical Monday. Until the big boss asked me to make the pitch for a prospective new client. After two years on shaky ground at work because of my screw up, an opportunity to impress the senior partners was just what I needed. Or so I thought… Until I walked into the conference room and collided with the man I was supposed to pitch. My coffee spilled, my files tumbled to the ground, and I almost lost my balance. And that was the good part of my day. Because the gorgeous man crouched down and looking at me like he wanted to eat me alive, was none other than my ex, Gray Westbrook. A man who I’d only just begun to move on from. A man who my heart despised—yet my body obviously still had other ideas about. A man who was as charismatic and confident as he was sexy.

Chase doesn't have an annual fee on the majority of their good earning cards. No silly $6500 cap . No having to book travel through specific methods. The amount of 3-5x categories is solid. The MR BBP is a good card, but if you believe that half a point (where then we could split hairs on valuation) makes that much of a difference overall, I'd disagree. Sure you can disagree.
1. There are 7 Chase CCs that do not have AFs, Freedom, FU, Slate, United TravelBank, Amazon, Disney and AARP. So I do not think your first statement is right.
2. The Freedom card has $6,000/year cap. I do not know what $6,500 AmEx cap you talking about.
3. The 5x airfair is flat, you do not have to do anything.

The environment, food and rural affairs select committee inquiry follows recent cases of real fur being sold as fake by retailers that had no-fur policies including TK Maxx, Amazon, Not On The High Street, Groupon, Etsy, Tesco, FatFace, Boots, Kurt Geiger and Romwe.
Committee chairman Neil Parish said: “The government must ensure that local authorities are properly resourced, and local authorities should ensure that Trading Standards are properly trained.”
Britain banned fur farming in 2000 but still imports and sells fur from species such as fox, rabbit, mink, coyote, raccoon dog and chinchilla.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “In our manifesto we said we would ban the import of fur and under the last Labour government the production of fur in Britain was stopped and it is now not produced in Britain, so we think it should not be imported either.”
A government spokesman claimed: “While the UK is a member of the EU it is not possible to introduce additional restrictions on the fur trade.”"

Well, the answer is that Today is Romeo Tanghal´s 75th anniversary and while I have written a lot about Marv Wolfman and George Perez contribution I haven´t always mentioned Romeo´s titanic inks on what is undoubtedly one of THE best Bronze Age comic series. Which is a bit strange since I always paid a lot of attention to the inkers on comics because - at least in my opinion - the inker can make or break a book. For me he is an integral part of the creative team and I also feel that when comic companies decide to forego the inking stage and just color directly on the pencils or ink digitally they squander a big opportunity. To me those books never look finished and it feels weird for me to pay money for a comic that doesn´t look like it is finished. And where would comics be Today without the great inkers like Josef Rubinstein, Terry Austin, Brett Breeding, Mark Farmer or Klaus Janson. Also would THE TOMB OF DRACULA have been as good without Tom Palmer´s inks on Gene Colan ? Which brings us back to Romeo Tanghal. When he started out he was just doing regular inks but over time George Perez did just breakdowns and Romeo was listed first as embellisher and then as finisher. So the look of NEW TEEN TITANS was in big part due to his work. He was the backbone and while George Perez provided the structure he did the heavy lifting. So since this post is about showcasing his work most of the art are original pages with the colored version - as usual. I would have liked to do a post just with that but I don´t have enough original art pages of good quality plus I am keeping a few pages for the DEATH IN COMICS : THE DEATH OF TERRA post that I still hope to write in the future. So there will also be some regular pages. Although with this title there are no regular pages. As for the NEW TEEN TITANS, as I have already mentioned in my last post by this time I have written so many posts about it that there is not much left to say which I haven´t written elsewhere. Also since there are too many posts to link to them all - especially if you count all the posts I have written about George Perez - you will just have to use the tags. Finally I can get some mileage about doing them. And one final word before we come to the rest of the original art pages by Romeo Tanghal there are also no recommendations for the NEW TEEN TITANS since you currently have a wide range of options if you want to check out this classic comic series. There are the Archive Editions which cover issues 1 to 27 that are a bit pricey at 50 bucks. They are better to read than the heavy omnibus editions and I have 3 of them but only because I found them at half price. You do get to see it in the size it was intended for though. Then there are the omnibus editions which used to be very expensive - especially the first volume when it was out of print - but are now available in a new edition at a reasonable price. You could get volumes 2 and 3 of the first printing through amazon at a very low price for the longest time and I have pimped those books enough. If you want to get the new editions, I have only the first one because I missed my chance with the first printing. Although that may be a good thing because according to the reviews I read online the binding was very bad and the books almost fell apart. With the new editions this seems to be a thing of the past but they changed the contents of volume 2 and 3 for some reason so if you already have volume 2 or 3 of the first printing and then buy volume 2 or 3 of the new printing you will have some issues twice and some issues will be missing. Last but not least the complete series is being reprinted in affordable trades and I have to get some because in the omnibus books they mainly concentrate on the issues by the creative team of Marv Wolfman and George Perez so they skipped a whole bunch. Okay, that was more than I thought I had to say about the subject so without any further delay here are some more original Titans pages by George Perez and Romeo Tanghal. Okay, one more thing. For all the things that made Slade Wilson a.k.a. The Terminator a badass what always bugged me was how he let the H.I.V. E. use and abuse him like a bitch. I mean they killed his son to get him to capture the Teen Titans for his and instead of figuring that out and taking his revenge on them he was always after the Titans. He should have killed every last one of those bastiches. For me he´s the book´s biggest dupe. Since I don´t have any links for this post and I already covered all the celebrity birthdays of the day last year and there is nothing new I have to add we are going straight to the video part. We start with a featurette on Filmation´s Batman & Robin but don´t ask me where I posted part one. With all the music videos I bookmarked there is none that really lends itself for a post about The Neww Teen Titans and since without the birthday section we have a certain lack of hot babes I am including this one to kill two birds with one stone. I can´t read what it says on there but the preview picture alone was enough for me to click it and the video really does not disappoint. I´m sure George Perez would approve of her. It´s back to comics with a duel between two former Robins. Under The Red Hood is one of the best stories in the Batuniverse with great art by Doug Mahnke that you should be able to find in finer comic book stores. The animated version is not as good because - as usual - they felt the need to leave out a lot of stuff ( mostly because they have not included it in previous animated movies and they think the audience gets confused by stuff they themselves don´t know ) but it´s good enough to watch it. We continue with the second episode of this series and I can´t believe it has taken me this long. I don´t know why but I really took a shining to it. And finally, closing out things Today here is another classic issue of The New Teen Titans by Marv Wolfman, George Perez and Romeo Tanghal. New to the blog ? Everything you need to know about TALES FROM THE KRYPTONIAN : top ten posts / more posts of interest / best of the best To the stables, Robin."

A Standalone Second Chance Romance Novel
By: #1 NY Times Best Selling Author, Vi Keeland
RELEASE DATE: Monday, July 23, 2018
Synopsis :
It was just a typical Monday.
Until the big boss asked me to make the pitch for a prospective new client.
After two years on shaky ground at work because of my screw up, an opportunity to impress the senior partners was just what I needed.
Or so I thought…
Until I walked into the conference room and collided with the man I was supposed to pitch.
My coffee spilled, my files tumbled to the ground, and I almost lost my balance.
And that was the good part of my day.
Because the gorgeous man crouched down and looking at me like he wanted to eat me alive, was none other than my ex, Gray Westbrook.
A man who I’d only just begun to move on from.
A man who my heart despised—yet my body obviously still had other ideas about.
A man who was as charismatic and confident as he was sexy.
Somehow, I managed to make it through my presentation ignoring his intense stare.
Although it was impossible to ignore all the dirty things he whispered into my ear right after I was done.
But there was no way I was giving him another chance, especially now that he was a client…was there?

Source One of the colleagues I network with emailed a detailed synopsis of what’s been going on in the EU, which apparently is not being covered nor journalistically reported by the mainstream media in the USA. Since the information I cite below came on an email string, I assume it is to be considered open access and in that open access spirit I want to inform my readers about what’s going on but, more importantly, to take note of it. Activism to oppose 5G with its refrigerator-size cell towers on a pole in front of your home, or even in your backyard, streaming powerful RF millimeter waves into your home, which you cannot oppose nor get moved due to U.S. FCC regulations , must become part of the Wi-Fi revolution focusing on valid health reasons, i.e., electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) and cancers , or suffer the consequences of dramatically ill health, as I’ve written about before. Source Below are pertinent excerpts from the voluminous email I received and which I think readers ought to know. “Our press briefing was held Thursday 28 June 2018 in Paris. Dr. Marc Arazi, President of the NGO, Phonegate Alert, together with two members of the scientific committee, Dr. Devra Davis (USA), President of the NGO, the Environmental Health Trust, and Dr. Annie Sasco, former chief of a research unit, at IARC-WHO, called for the withdrawal of millions of mobile phones that present a risk to health, particularly of children.” [….] “For her part, Dr. Annie Sasco recalled the basis on which IARC correctly classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields in 2011 as belonging to group 2B, possible carcinogens for humans. Since 2011, new epidemiological studies (Cephalo, CERENAT) have confirmed the increased risk of brain tumors for the most exposed persons (intense use of the phone, long duration in terms of years of use, with an excess risk for people who started using the phone at an early age, and also an excess risk for the most exposed areas of the brain, especially on the side of regular phone use).” [….] “Finally, Dr Devra Davis, President of the Environmental Health Trust, stressed the increased risks for children: “My research and the work of dozens of other scientists show that sperm is damaged by cell phone radiation. The Cleveland clinic advises men who want to become fathers to take phones out of their pocket. The State of California also says people should keep phones off the body.” Source: Appeal for the withdrawal of more than 250 mobile phone models in France, Europe and internationally —– 1st scientific conference on 5G and Health, Organized by the Stop 5G platform, and the EHS and MCS Association Experts predict an increase in health problems associated with increased electromagnetic pollution. Electrosensitive, the first victims of the expansion of new mobile telephony networks. The society continues without taking conscience of the sanitary impact that will suppose the models of technological development to the service of the industrial interests. We reproduce this text that the Electro and Chemical Sensitive Association for the Right to Health (EQSDS) has sent us. On Saturday, June 16, the 1st Scientific Conference 5G and Health took place in Segovia. In coordination with the Stop 5G Platform, the Electro and Chemical Sensitive Association for the Right to Health has organized the event. During the morning, in the old Faculty of Teaching, before 200 people from different places, experts in electromagnetic fields and health sciences have reviewed the implications of the excessive development of radio frequency transmission technologies. The speakers included Dr. Annie Sasco, former director of epidemiology at IARC, and Ceferino Maestu, director of the Bioelectromagnetism Laboratory at the Polytechnic University of Madrid. In the afternoon, a human chain was made in the center of the city that concluded with the reading of a Manifesto in the Plaza Mayor. The human chain wore a 300-meter-long woven scarf symbolizing the balance between the traditional and the modern through the safe use of technology. At the end of the tour shoes were placed on the ground reminding those affected that for health or economic reasons could not attend. The electrosensitive are the first group damaged by the rise of electromagnetic pollution as a result of the expansion of telephone networks such as the future 5G network. People affected by the Syndrome of Intolerance to Electromagnetic Fields, used by mobile phones and other wireless transmission systems such as wifis, are in some cases in an emergency situation. Electrosensitive people are people who are forced to leave their homes, who have difficulty using public transport or even to attend a hospital in case of emergency because there are no protocols for their care without exposing them to the agent causing their symptoms. A part of them lose their social and family relationships, and some have no choice but to escape to isolated places looking for places with less burden of electromagnetic pollution leaving behind everything that is dear to them.

During the meeting at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, however, they found out that these managers avoided installing Wi-Fi connections in their offices (4). The underlying problem is that the safety of electromagnetic fields has been delegated to engineers, while it must be entrusted to biologists and doctors. To this day, the NON-THERMIC BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS have been underestimated, ie not due to the heating produced by the radiation on living matter. These effects occur for exposures of low power density, that is, far below the current legal limits.” —– How would you like this 5G cell tower parked in front of your home?

Click to expand... Ok. The following is what I've been using for a while now and am pretty happy with them. It's a 65 inch version and settings might not work equally well with other sets.
The vast majority of these settings are copied from Blackwiggle who calibrated his set with calibration equipment. The rest are my own adjustments to reduce the colour errors on my set and bring it closer to what I had on my vt50 plasma in THX mode. I can honestly say that I’m extremely happy with this set, and it now looks way better than my old VT50 plasma in THX mode.
I have done this by trial and error (lots of it) and by eye, using my Spears and Munsil disc and R Masciola’s UHDHDR10 test patterns, as well as my Samsung S7 screen to compare (which has a very accurate rec 709). I have also trialled every set of calibrations provided on the internet and made combinations of them ad nauseam until I found the following.
Blackwiggle’s original EX750 Settings are to be found at: Panasonic EX750 Owners Thread
The white balance across the board, in all preset modes, is inaccurate. There is huge excess of blue at the low ire level creating very inaccurate colour, especially in darker scenes.
I also urge anyone tweaking their set to allow settings to bed in for 2-3 days. I have found it sometimes takes this long for the tv to sort itself out. Don’t ask me why. Initially it may look odd or dull, but can have backlight bleed at the edges also which seems to just slowly dissipate over 1 or 2 or 3 days. Also the left side seems to retain a bluish tinge for a few days after using the settings panel. Again, no idea why. And this will be most obvious if you reset it back to default. If you put up with these distractions, you’ll see the benefits as it will disappear and create good uniformity. After a week or so it should be about right (although the left side blue tinge can persist a bit longer in HDR mode).
If there's anything I've left out, just assume it's the default setting.
Viewing distance 5.4-8.1 feet. You have to be sitting centrally for best experience and if too close you can find some minor backlight bleed issues at either side.

There was just a placeholder image at the time but today Amazon has uploaded the following picture of the front cover:
While the comic's creator/editor/writer Barrie Tomlinson is unfortunately not involved in this actual book, it's good to see his name taking pride of place on the cover like this, alongside Ian Kennedy , John Sanders and Vanyo , who brought the character to life on the page.
Rebellion have also now included the following description of the book:
"" Post-Earth pulp space opera of discovery and adventure! In 2488 Earth history professor Turbo Jones predicted that the planet would be destroyed in 2500 by a vast meteoroid storm. Ridiculed by the world's leaders, Turbo spent the next twelve years constructing a huge spaceship and employing a group of volunteers to help him leave the Earth and find a new home in the stars. After months in space Turbo and his senior staff, including former mercenary Loner, the mysterious Kitten Magee and the last survivor of Xgangbe-4, Joe Alien, have found a potential new home. Now they need to get down onto the planet and make sure it is safe for the five hundred colonists and livestock aboard the Wildcat. ""
Beyond that there's not an awful lot to go on, including no page count as yet, but the price has already dropped from £14.99 to £13.19 (so order it up now to take advantage of the pre-order guarantee) and it's confirmed as a paperback. There'll be more news as and when it's released and watch out for full Oink! Blog-esque Wildcat coverage in a few short months when each and every issue is written up right here.

Reprinted from Deadline Hollywood by David Robb on May 11, 2018 .
Netflix , Amazon and Hulu will be paying a lot more in writers’ residuals under the new WGA film and TV contract. New details, outlined by WGA West, reveal that high-budget shows they run will generate anywhere between $3,448-$34,637 more residuals per episode over the life of the three-year contract than they did under the old contract, depending on the platform and the length of the show.
Essentially, it’s the same deal the DGA got in their negotiations last December.
The WGA contract, which has been unanimously approved by the WGA West board and the WGA East council , now goes to the guilds’ members for final ratification. Voting begins tomorrow and concludes May 24. The old contract expired May 2.
The new residual formula includes, for services with 1 million or more subscribers in the U.S. and Canada, a domestic residual of 35% of an applicable minimum after 90 days of availability. Residuals will also be due for reuse on foreign-affiliated SVOD services. “In general,” the guild says, “if an HBSVOD program is available worldwide on the SVOD service, the residual payment will be a percent of the domestic residual (35% for each of the first three years, a declining percent thereafter). If the HBSVOD program is available in some foreign markets, but not worldwide, the residual will be 1.2% of the license fee for the foreign markets.” … About Jeffrey Burman 2868 Articles Jeff Burman represents assistant editors on the Guild’s Board of Directors.

And Welcome to Miss TaffeytheChamp’s Blog!
{Gorgeous Keanu Reeves Image at a Golden Globe Awards ceremony from: https://goo.gl/images/DEUoGH }
{Cutie Pie Keanu Reeves Image from: https://goo.gl/images/kmJiFG }
By now, I am quite certain that many of you are familiar with my Muse , Keanu Reeves ’ expansive repertoire of films. Yet, I wonder how familiar you are with the plentiful romantic character roles that this endearing gentleman has portrayed over the years. Thus, I shall be mentioning another 3 of his romantic onscreen personas.
{Stunning Keanu Reeves as Jack Traven in Speed cover Image from: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111257/mediaviewer/rm4192537344 }
One of these romantic male leads is the scintillating hero cop, “Jack Traven” , from the Blockbuster film, “Speed” . And for those of you who are not aware, this non-stop action film actually heralded Keanu Reeves’ success as an actor to be reckoned with on the big screen. No one in their right mind would argue that this was a very romantic character role. I mean, who wouldn’t want someone who looked like Keanu Reeves rescuing them from some mad bomber, or any other villain-archetype? I certainly wouldn’t, and this fact definitely would not surprise my Muse , Keanu Reeves , where I, his little Musee , am concerned.
{ Keanu Reeves as Jack Traven in Speed Image from: https://goo.gl/images/vhFD7C }
Next in line is the film drama about fated romantic love entitled as, “The Lake House ” . And in this film, Keanu Reeves portrays highly-skilled and incredibly romantic architect, “Alex Wyler ” . Two professional individuals are living 2 years apart according to an amazing break in the space-time continuum. What is rather remarkable is how these two people discover via exchange of letters that they are living two years apart. “ Alex Wyler” is living in the year 2004, and “ Kate Forster ” (portrayed by Sandra Bullock) is living in the year 2006.
{ The Lake House cover Image from: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410297/mediaviewer/rm1478069248 }
Throughout this love story, I found it surprising how these two characters were capable of recalling certain prior dates in time, where they were precisely, and what they were doing on those dates. What was even more magical was how they were able to encounter one another during “ Kate’s ” past in the year 2004. Now, in my opinion, I found Keanu Reeves ’, “ Alex Wyler ” character, more determined to have a future relationship with Sandra Bullock’s , “ Kate Forster ” character.
{ Keanu Reeves in The Lake House Image from: https://goo.gl/images/5a2ma2 }
The “Kate” character appeared lost, depressed, and in a state of limbo; which does not bode well for romance. And with such a dreamboat male-archetype showing such arousing interest, it did not make sense how reserved she was with having a future intimate relationship with “Alex” . Overall, however, this entrancing film contained some delightfully romantic scenes.
{ Keanu Reeves at The Lake House UK premiere Image from: https://goo.gl/images/uRcykS }
And last, but not least, is the dashingly handsome, endearingly chivalrous, and soldiering hero, “Paul Sutton ” character, hailing from the “A Walk in the Clouds ” dramatic film. This character poses as a pregnant woman’s husband to protect her from being disowned by her father who possesses old-fashioned views. Now, we all are aware that most men would not do this. Though, there are definitely a small number of gentlemen who would be a as chivalrous in this modern day and age. But, my Muse , Keanu Reeves , was the most adorably attractive and gallant gentleman whilst portraying this character, “Paul Sutton ” .
{Keanu Reeves in A Walk in the Clouds cover Image from: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114887/mediaviewer/rm3593838080 }
All in all, all three of these characters possessed tremendous romantic appeal. And I am certain that I am not the only lady that feels this way.

My mom, sister, and I all use the same amazon account. We each just got new Kindles. When I borrowed a book from the library I chose the option for it to be sent to my kindle. However, it showed up on all three kindle devices, not just mine. The same has happened when my mom and sister have borrowed books, despite us all choosing to send the books to our own respective devices. Is there any way to prevent this from happening? How can I have the library book sent exclusively to my own kindle and not automatically download on the rest of my family's devices?

Arguing that modern libraries hold no value anymore and are merely a drain on taxpayers , Forbes thinks Amazon should replace them with their own bookstores in local communities instead. Based on their successes in the book and streaming businesses, the company certainly has the experience to do just that, but many are voicing their outrage at turning community-friendly centers into what would be just another corporate landmark.
Amazon Books is a chain of bookstores that does what Amazon originally intended to do; replace the local bookstore. It improves on the bookstore model by adding online searches and coffee shops. Amazon Go basically combines a library with a Starbucks. At the core, Amazon has provided something better t"

If you find that hard to believe, this next one will make your head explode: We can expect Big Pharma to put a lot of weight behind this proposal's passage.
The Health and Human Services Department (HHS) recently submitted a plan that could block the rebates that keep expanding the rift between listed drug prices the smaller sums that companies such as Merck & Co. ( NYSE:MRK ) , Eli Lilly ( NYSE:LLY ) , and Johnson & Johnson ( NYSE:JNJ ) actually collect. Regulating these rebates could be a huge win for drugmakers and consumers. Here's what you need to know.
Image source: Getty Images.
Worse than you probably imagined Drugmakers make themselves awfully unpopular when they raise prices on branded drugs each year, and the industry's claim that entities between consumers and their products are at fault makes a lot more sense now than it did just a couple of years ago.
Government-run health schemes generally negotiate prices with drugmakers as a single entity, but not in the United States. Instead, insurers hire, and acquire , pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) to negotiate on their behalf. These PBMs wrangle discounts and rebates from the world's drugmakers in return for placing their high-priced drugs on affordable copay tiers.
In recent years, insurers have been supplementing premiums by charging copay percentages on list prices that have accelerated way past the net prices drugmakers realize. According to IQVIA, a healthcare analytics provider, the chasm between list and net prices on branded drugs rose to $153 billion in 2017.
The practice has become so bothersome to Johnson & Johnson, Merck, and Eli Lilly that all three broke protocol and shared some disturbing figures that show the practice is getting out of hand.
Company
Average Discount to List Price in 2013 Average Discount to List Price in 2017 List Price Change in 2017 Net Price Change in 2017 Merck & Co. 32% 45% 6.6% (1.9%) Johnson & Johnson N/A 42% 8.5% (-4.6%) Eli Lilly 30% 51% 9.7% 6% Data source: company presentations.
The average total discount that Merck provides has surged from an arguably generous 27% in 2010 to a whopping 45% last year. Lilly enjoyed a reprieve in 2017, but its list price raises exceeded realized net price increases by 10.2% in 2014 and 12.6% in 2016.
Why it could happen Nothing changes quickly in healthcare, but big pharma stock investors will be happy to know that the Trump administration can probably make this happen. Anti-kickback laws aimed at curbing corruption and organized crime are specifically relaxed when it comes to everyday drug pricing practices. Rescinding exemptions that make rebates possible won't go over well with the PBM industry, but the proposal in front of the Trump administration doesn't require any new legislation to make its way through Congress.
Details of the HHS proposal aren't available yet, but its title, ""Removal of Safe Harbor Protection for Rebates to Plans or PBMs Involving Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Creation of New Safe Harbor Protection,"" sounds like music to the ears of pharmaceutical companies tired of receiving negative publicity despite lowering net prices.
The pharma industry traditionally defends its right to charge any price it sees fit, so it's been shocking to see that Roche , Novartis , Bayer , and Merck KFaA have pledged not to raise drug prices for the rest of the year following a similar agreement Pfizer made with the president earlier this month. I'm sure all these pricing pledges are just benevolent acts on behalf of corporations that realized how grateful they are at the same time, but that doesn't mean their collective action won't ease the HHS proposal's passage.
Image source: Getty Images.
What to look for As far as we know, the proposed rebate regulation isn't anything more than a descriptive title at the moment, and I imagine details concerning new safe-harbor regulations are still being hashed out. Following recent promises to limit price increases by the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, though, it looks as if the days of escalating rebates are coming to a close.
Tighter regulation of rebates could be a big step toward the sort of drug pricing transparency that consumers crave. America's largest insurer, UnitedHealth Group Inc. , acquired its own PBM years ago, which allowed it to begin passing some rebates from drugmakers directly to its customers earlier this year.
Amazon.com has taken several steps into the healthcare arena, the most recent of which gave it licenses to distribute drugs throughout all 50 states. Nobody's quite sure how the online retail giant will shake up the way Americans shop for prescription drugs, but more pricing transparency could accelerate the process."

And, given their unbiased guest list, I’m impressed that it hadn’t happen sooner.
The View’s guest last Thursday, as most of you know by now, was Judge Jeanine Pirro, out hawking her new book, ‘Liars, Leakers, and Liberals’. (I’d almost kill to have gotten that spot for my new book, ‘ Ruby and Jared ,’ and have had Whoopi Goldberg yell at me. But, I digress.)
I feel that Whoopi’s anger stemmed from having someone, get in your face, and tell you – while smiling at the camera – that something is good when you know in your soul that it’s bad.
I’ve been there (people telling me that I’m imaging the stalkers following me and outside by home screaming obscenities when I know they’re real) and I know, it can be the most frustrating thing in the world. It just goes to show that Whoopi Goldberg is human and a Star. I’m hoping the producers of The View will keep her on the show.
Ms. Pirro, instead of cursing out the staff, you should have gotten down on your knees and thanked God. I read that your book is now No. 1. Send those girls, on The View, gift baskets purchased from the profits of your book.
And then, after all of that hoopla with Ms. Pirro, I read that Joy Behar is leaving because Mike Pence got upset about something she said.
How thin-skinned is he? Talk about petty nonsense. I listen to a whole lot worse every day of my life and I’m not espousing that someone get fired from their job because of it. No, I just ask that they don’t assume and do a better job while keeping an open mind.
And as far as Joy thinking that hearing from God is a sign of mental illness, I have to say highly educated and rich people, who have no need for God have thought that for centuries. Nothing new about that.
And I still love watching The View with Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sara Haines, Sunny Hostin, and Meghan MaCain (I don’t think you’re an ice b_ _ _ _ _. I’m all for women keeping their business to themselves.)

From Valledupar, the cradle of vallenato music, to Rio de Janeiro, where samba carioca was born, Chabuco breaks geographical barriers and seamlessly fuses two musical worlds, making them sound as one. The marriage of those two great traditions, vallenato and samba/bossa nova is a match made in heaven in Encuentro , the newest album of the Colombian artist known as Chabuco.
But who is Chabuco? I confess he was not on my radar until recently, when I watched the beautiful documentary La Guitarra Vuela: Soñando a Paco de Lucía (Flight of the Guitar: Dreaming of Paco De Lucía) . Even though we are now more connected than ever through the technological marvel of the internet, sometimes living in the northern part of the American continent (Toronto, Canada in my case) we tend to miss some great artists from the south. But this new album, Encuentro , will surely give Chabuco the exposure he well deserves, not only throughout America but throughout the world indeed.
José Darío Martínez Acosta, better known as Chabuco, is a singer, composer, musician and producer who was born in Valledupar, Colombia. His father, extraordinary guitarist Hugues Martínez, is a living legend of the coastal folklore in the region. Chabuco was raised surrounded by art and artists: musicians, composers, painters. At an early age he started playing guitar, accordion, percussion, and developing his own voice. Joining the band “Los Pelaos” in Bogotá was an important step in his career, touring internationally throughout Europe, Latin America and Unites States.
Chabuco started his solo career after separating from Los Pelaos in 2000. He released his first album, Morirme de Amor with Cuban composer and producer Alfredo Nodarse in 2002. A project not so successful commercially speaking, it delightfully fused vallenato music with the Afro-Caribbean rhythms of the largest island of the Greater Antilles, Cuba. In 2008, Chabuco’s second album, Nació mi Poesía saw the light. This time he teamed up with Colombian musician Nicolás De Los Ríos. Both represented a new generation of vallenato interpreters that took a new, modern approach, mixing different Latin rhythms and giving a modern twist to the genre. Two years after, in 2010, Clásicos Café La Bolsa came out. A compilation of traditional vallenatos recorded as a tribute to a historic place in Valledupar where great musicians used to meet and play, the likes of Rafael Escalona, ‘Colacho’ Mendoza, the Zuleta, Lorenzo Morales and Hugues Martínez, Chabuco’s father. On this album, we find Chabuco mixing vallenato with boleros and jazz in a very fine way. It was greatly accepted by avid listeners of his musical experimentation, and won him numerous new fans. And then in 2013 De Ida Y Vuelta was released to great acclaim. A very successful project recorded in Madrid, Barcelona and Los Angeles and produced by José Miguel (Josemi) Carmona, ex-member of the new flamenco group Ketama. The fusion of flamenco, jazz with vallenato was magnificent. Some of the great artists who participated on this album were Kike Purizaga, Diego Valdéz, Carlos Huertas, Horacio ‘El negro Hernández’ and Israel Suárez ‘Piraña’. BUY THIS ALBUM ON AMAZON.COM
Five years later, May 2018, and Chabuco releases his fifth album, Encuentros , fulfilling a longtime dream of fusing the music of his native Valledupar with the sensuous Brasilian rhythms of samba and bossa nova. Recorded in São Paulo, Encuentros showcases collaborations with Alejandro Sanz, Vicente García, José Quiñónez, Zé Godoy (pianist), Richie Flores (conga player). For this very special project Chabuco enlisted Swami Jr. as producer. An excellent guitarist (7-string guitar), bassist, arranger and composer, Swami Jr. is one of the most creative and versatile Brasilian musicians nowadays. Editor’s Pick · Featured Album · Chabuco: Encuentro
10 songs make for a short programme that makes you keep asking for more after only 33 minutes of magnificent renditions, but it doesn’t demerit the impact the music and the beautiful arrangements have on the listener. Every song is a hit, beginning to end. “Amor Comprado” (Armando Zabaleta); “La Casa en el Aire” (Rafael Escalona); “Ausencia” (Santander Durán Escalona); “Amor Sensible” (Freddy Molina); “El Cantor de Fonseca” (Carlos Enrique Huertas) and “El Almirante Padilla” (Rafael Escalona) are true anthems of the Colombian vallenato songbook, and Chabuco and Swami Jr. infuse them with new life for the enjoyment of lovers of both, Colombian and Brasilian musical traditions.
“Besito de Agua” is a co-creation of Chabuco and José Quiñónez; “Margarita” was written by Chabuco, Vicente García and José Quiñónez, and “Mi Samba” is a composition of Chabuco and José Quiñónez. “Muñeca de Porcelana” is a composition of Alfredo Nodarse that Chabuco had recorded on his first album, Morirme de Amor , in 2002, but he wanted to give it a new treatment.
Everyone will have her/his favourite tunes on this album, mine are: “Amor Comprado”, that sets the most relaxing mood from the very first note on this encounter; “Besito de Agua”, so full of magical imagery and Colombian landscapes; “Margarita”, a love song dedicated to the woman of every man’s fantasy in all of her arresting beauty; “La Casa en el Aire”, one of the most striking vallenato tunes full of magical realism. I simply adore this new version. “Ausencia” makes for a glorius duet, Chabuco and Alejandro Sanz, with his characteristic, raspy voice and “Muñeca de Porcelana”, a beautiful ballad that sounds so romantic and enchanting on this new version.
The musicians on this recording deserve more than a big round of applause for their talent, their flawless performances and contributions that make of this album a precious object that music lovers will surely hold dear to their hearts.

This weekend, specifically July 21, would have been the 67th birthday of beloved comedian Robin Williams. To celebrate his legacy, Ancestry.com unearthed some intriguing information about the iconic American actor — notably, how the Hollywood roles we know and love him for are linked to the jobs held by distant relatives.
For example, Williams was known to perform for our military troops in conjunction with the USO. Did you know that, on his family tree, there are numerous people who were involved in wars? There's Tobias Williams, his three-time great-grandfather, who served in the North Carolina militia during the War of Independence in 1778 ( source ). Then there's Thomas Whitlow (his two-time great-grandfather), who served with the Virginia militia during the War of 1812 ( source ). Finally there's Haywood Ross Williams his great-grandfather, who served with the Confederacy in the Civil War and was actually a prisoner of war ( source ).
Take a trip down memory lane as we take a look at the roles Williams played and see how they uniquely relate to him, specifically when comparing them to the Oscar winner's family tree. Amazon Domestic/Nanny: ""Mrs. Doubtfire""
The actor's paternal great-grandmother, Sarah Melissa Fitzgerrell (née Whitlow), served as a “domestic” in the household of Moses Neal in 1860 (Source: 1860 U.S. Federal Census ). Amazon Lawyer: ""Hook""
Charles Janin, Williams's three-time great-grandfather, was born in France and moved to New Orleans where he built a career as a wealthy lawyer (Source: 1850 U.S. Federal Census ). Amazon Doctors: ""Awakenings,""""Patch Adams"" (pictured), and ""What Dreams May Come"" Williams' maternal great-grandfather, Dr. John Pleasant Berry, was a medical doctor from Mississippi (Source: Directory of Deceased American Physicians ).
If one doctor weren’t enough, the star's three-time great-grandfather, Holden Evans, was a physician who practiced in Mississippi (Source: 1850 U.S. Federal Census ). Amazon Teachers: ""Dead Poets Society"" (pictured) and ""Good Will Hunting""
Elizabeth Fitzgerrel, Williams' cousin (first cousin, twice removed), worked as a teacher in the 1880s while living at home with her parents, Daniel and Harriet (Source: 1880 U.S. Federal Census ). Amazon Politician: ""Man of the Year""
Williams' two-time great-grandfather was Anselm Joseph McLaurin, governor of Mississippi from 1896-1900 and United States senator from 1894-1895 and 1900-1909 (Source: Obituary ). Amazon Sales: ""Cadillac Man"" (pictured) and ""One Hour Photo""
Herbert Janin, Williams' maternal great-grandfather, worked as a “salesman” at a “drug house” in New Orleans. According to 1910, 1920, and 1930 censuses, this was most equivalent to a pharmaceutical company rep who would sell to drug stores (Source: 1900 U.S. Federal Census ). Amazon Banker: ""Boulevard""
Williams' two-time great-grandfather, Leon F. Janin Sr., worked as a banker for many years in New Orleans (Source: Times-Picayune, 21 May 1876 )."

I remember how excited I was when I heard the extraordinary news that the Museum of the Bible was going to be built in Washington.
There are so many museums in the nation’s capital, as everyone knows – dozens of Smithsonians, portrait galleries, the Holocaust Museum, American Indian art, the Newseum, etc. It’s not only the capital of the country, it’s the museum capital of the world.
But, until recently, there wasn’t a museum dedicated to the Bible – not in D.C., not in my town.
Now, I understand that it’s a private institution and those who funded it have every right to set the parameters for its content. But I recently figured out there’s at least one biblical subject you won’t find there – not in the permanent exhibits, not even in the bookstore. It kind of surprised me – and disappointed.
Months ago, as I was putting the finishing touches on my new book, “The Gospel in Every Book of the Old Testament,” gathering endorsements and thinking about where I would most like to see it available, I wrote to the Museum of the Bible and sent an early electronic preview copy. I had, in fact, just heard from Franklin Graham’s office that he wanted to place it in the Billy Graham Library and provided a beautiful and thoughtful cover endorsement. That prompted the idea, along with several others.
I had a nice encouraging conversation with the director of the bookstore. She explained all books went through an extensive review process before being ordered, which didn’t surprise me, but didn’t discourage me either. This is and was, as some others had suggested, a “breakthrough Bible book,” in that it systematically searched out the Good News message of redemption and restoration that I had found so prevalent in many of the books, but also in all 39 of the Hebrew Scriptures – from Genesis to Malachi.
I waited a month or so, not having received any reply.
“The Gospel in Every Book of the Old Testament is now available in e-book format at Amazon.com and the WND Superstore, with the hardcover version to be released in September nationwide.
When I checked back with my contact, I found she had left the position. I had a deuce of a time finding out who replaced her. Finally, I found two new names. I started the process all over. Apparently I hadn’t actually got to first base yet.
Another month went by and I checked in by email. One of the two contacts I had for email bounced, but one got through. I waited another month and tried again – nothing. After a few weeks, I got the news.
She explained nicely that the book had been rejected because of the museum’s mission, which did not include “evangelism” nor “apologetics.”
That surprised me for two reasons: The Bible itself is thoroughly evangelistic – from beginning to end. It’s the story of Israel and its role in the coming of the Redeemer and Messiah, who will ultimately restore the Kingdom to God’s chosen people and, in the process, restore the entire Earth to the way God created it when He pronounced it “very good” in Genesis 1:31, before the fall of mankind. That this entire Bible was miraculously woven together by about 40 different authors over 1,500 years with one cohesive message in all 66 books, I thought, was evidence of God’s inspiration – and certainly something worth knowing. In fact, I notice there are historical exhibits in the museum that do reveal archaeological evidence that so much of the Bible is verifiably true. That, to me, is the essence of evangelism. It’s the heart and soul of the Good News Israel was commanded to take to the entire world as a light to the nations. In other words, it is the Gospel. I also noticed the recent announcement of plans by the museum for a new Billy Graham exhibit. Billy Graham’s entire life was devoted to evangelism – spreading that Gospel message.
But the explanation to me that there is sensitivity, if you will, that the founders of the Bible Museum has toward evangelism and apologetics, was news. How, I wondered, could you adequately and thoroughly create and maintain the massive institution that is the Bible Museum without the evangelistic nature of the Bible itself, which is God’s inspired Word to His people?
There was some specific verbiage in the rejection letter that also struck me: “The books that we carry tend to be more on the historical and factual side of the spectrum.”
My book is just that. It’s just the facts – using almost entirely the Bible and what it actually says in the text itself. In that sense, it is as historical and factual as a book can be.
Yes, I am disappointed that my book will not be available at the Museum of the Bible.
More importantly, though, I’m disappointed in the reason.
“The Gospel in Every Book of the Old Testament is now available in e-book format at Amazon.com and the WND Superstore, with the hardcover version to be released in September nationwide."

She's getting tired of pretzels and goldfish. It's getting harder and harder to get her to eat salty snacks so I'm trying to research salt tablets again. How much salt/sodium is in your kid's salt tablets? She's a teeny 8 year old and I just don't want to overdo it. But we've underdone it in the past (way back when she was a toddler) and ended up in the ER for rehydration.
I found these which are advertised as being used for medical conditions (POTS, EDS and CF) but do they have too much salt for a kid? https://www.amazon.com/SaltStick-Vitassium-Buffered-Electrolyte-Capsules/dp/B01MQWGTUO/ref=pd_bxgy_121_img_3?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B01MQWGTUO&pd_rd_r=9V9K1HYAMBTG18SP9GB0&pd_rd_w=bdAvp&pd_rd_wg=VCPKV&psc=1&refRID=9V9K1HYAMBTG18SP9GB0&dpID=415GY1DAUWL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=detail&tag=bccmty-20

I can't decide which ones might be the best for her. I've seen the last two in the CF (credible friend) mamas FB group but I can't find any CF (credible friend) users for the first one. We use electrolyte powder in her water but she's been fighting us on that lately too. She drinks plenty of water but obviously on hotter days she still needs some salt and/or electrolytes as well. It would also be nice to keep a bottle at her school instead of a whole family size bag of pretzels. So talk to me about salt please! How much salt is too much? We've always heard you can't give too much salt but when you're giving 500mg worth per salt pill... I don't know... Does anyone know how many mg of salt is in 1/4 teaspoon? I found multiple answers on Google."

Kindles are dedicated e-readers from the ground up. Fire tablets (Possibly what you mean by ""other Kindles?"") are general use tablets with Kindle reading capabilities ""Baked in"". They work similarly but not identically because a Fire is much more than just a book reader.
If you are unsure what you have, you can look in your account under ""Manage Devices and Content"" and the model(s) and what they are will be shown. The ""field guide"" method is thus, If the screen is in full color and looks like a tablet with loads of things to do: THat's a Fire. If it is off-white/grayish and only shows shades of gray and seems dedicated to reading, it's a Kindle in one form or another: Paperwhite, Voyage, Oasis and just plain Kindle or Basic Kindle for some older models. (Plus some other, really obsolete things like Kindle Touch and Kindle Keyboard.)
Amazon does not help inasmuch as they used to call Fire tablets Kindles and still do some places so confusion is very easily obtained. :)
I hope that helps alleviate confusion a bit, if not post more questions and someone will chime in. We're a friendly group and lots of people hang out here to offer help."

Here are only two of my visual samples for the interior of their famed Opera House in Manaus. The second view is from one of the two grand boxes that were immediately overlooking the stage for the rich rubber barons who lived here during the peak years of their economy.:

Here is just one sample from our little ""walk"" in the rainforest 60 miles north of Manaus. Fortunately, no rain for us. But, we would have other challenges. When you walk into the ""jungle"", you get out of the sun and can really feel things not being as hot. BUT, it was still very humid. Christine, our guide from Amazon Ecco Adventure Tours, did an excellent job and was super hard-working as we ""progressed"" along these complicated trails that gave us a taste from being an explorer like Indiana Jones.:

Here We Go Again’ to Land at No. 1,2018-07-22T22:46:00.000+03:00,news,US,5,Rebecca Rubin,"In a twist straight out of a movie, “ The Equalizer 2 ” shot past “ Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again ” to steal the box office crown. Going into the weekend, it looked like “Mamma Mia! 2” would easily debut at No. 1. Final numbers won’t come in until Monday, but weekend estimates show Sony’s “The Equalizer” sequel opened above estimates with $35.8 million when it launched in 3,388 locations, while Universal’s highly anticipated follow-up to “Mamma Mia!” debuted with $34.4 million from 3,317 screens.
“Equalizer 2,” the first sequel of Denzel Washington’s nearly four-decade long career, launched ahead of its predecessor. 2014’s “The Equalizer” opened with $35 million and went on to generate $192 million worldwide, including $101 million domestically.
“It was a surprise to come in at No 1. in an extremely competitive marketplace,” Adrian Smith, Sony’s head of domestic distribution, said. “It really speaks to the power of Denzel, without a doubt. We expect it to play to a great multiple.”
Antoine Fuqua returned to direct “ The Equalizer 2 ,” which also stars Pedro Pascal, Ashton Sanders, Melissa Leo, and Bill Pullman. Though it got a head start on the original film at the box office, reception has been less enthusiastic for the sequel, which currently holds a tepid 50% average on Rotten Tomatoes.
“ Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again ” couldn’t dance its way to the top of the domestic box office, but its $34 million opening is still a win. The original “Mamma Mia!” hit theaters a decade ago with $27 million. It became a box office hit, amassing $615 million worldwide on a $52 million budget. Much like the first film, the sequel will likely be a smash overseas, where Swedish pop group ABBA has a huge following.
“The results from audiences has really been electric,” Jim Orr, Universal’s president of domestic distribution said. “There was a pent-up wait to see this after the first film generated such goodwill.”
Aside from “Ocean’s 8” and “Book Club,” few offerings this summer have targeted female audiences. Orr said that, along with overseas appeal, should give the jukebox musical long legs at the box office.
Much of the star-studded cast — including Amanda Seyfried, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard, Colin Firth, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, and Dominic Cooper — returned for the second film. Lily James made her debut as the younger version of Meryl Streep’s charming and carefree Donna, while living legend Cher also joined the cast. Ol Parker, the screenwriter behind “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,” took over directing duties and penned the script.
The final wide release of the weekend, BH Tilt’s “ Unfriended: Dark Web ,” got off to a scary start. The low-budget horror film debuted way below projections with $3.5 million from 1,546 locations. That might not matter, considering the Blumhouse title carries a $1 million price tag. “Dark Web” is a standalone sequel to 2015’s “Unfriended.” That film became a cash cow, opening with $15 million and going on to earn $64 million from a $1 million budget.
“The Grudge” and “Texas Chainsaw 3D” writer Stephen Susco made his directorial debut with “Dark Web,” which features Colin Woodell, Rebecca Rittenhouse, Betty Gabriel, and Andrew Lees.
Among holdovers, “Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation” nabbed third place during its second outing. Sony’s animated sequel picked up another $23 million from 4,267 locations, bringing its domestic tally to $91 million.
In fourth, Marvel’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp” pocketed $16 million from 3,778 screens in its third frame. In total, the Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily-led superhero blockbuster has made $165 million.
Disney-Pixar’s “Incredibles 2” rounded out the top five with $11.5 million. In six weeks, the animated sequel has earned a massive $557 million in North America.
Meanwhile, Dwayne Johnson’s “Skyscraper” continues to struggle in North America. Universal’s action adventure dropped 56% in its sophomore weekend, collecting $11 million in 3,822 locations. The studio is hoping for massive returns internationally, where it opens this weekend in China.
At the specialty box office, Lionsgate’s “Blindspotting” bowed with $332,500 when it opened in 14 theaters. That’s a solid per-screen-average of $23,750. Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal co-wrote and star in “Blindspotting, which debuted to raves at this year’s Sundance Film Festival.
Bleecker Street’s “McQueen,” a documentary chronicling the life of iconic fashion designer Alexander McQueen, landed the top theater average of the weekend with $24,232. It scored $96,928 when it opened in four theaters.
Another new offering, Amazon Studios’ “Generation Wealth,” bowed on four screens with $33,602 for a per-theater-average of $8,401.
A24’s “Eighth Grade” continued to receive high marks in its second frame. Bo Burnham’s directorial debut continued its rollout to 32 locations, where it earned $794,000 — averaging $24,072 per screen.
Elsewhere, documentaries have continued their hot streak. Neon’s “Three Identical Strangers” brought in another $1.4 million. In four weeks, the acclaimed doc has earned $4.3 million. Focus Features’ “Won’t You Be My Neighbor” has now surpassed $18.4 million, including $1.3 million this weekend. Magnolia and Participant’s “RBG” has crossed $13 million, picking up $168,000 in its 12th frame, while Roadside Attraction’s “Whitney” made $118,470, taking its total to $2.8 million.
Annapurna’s “Sorry to Bother You” cracked the top 10 domestically with $2.8 million when it expanded to 1,050 locations. In total, Boots Riley’s dark comedy has collected $10.3 million.
Other holdovers include Amazon Studios’ “Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot” ($265,360 from 62 screens) and Bleecker Street’s “Leave No Trace” ($891,545 from 361 locations).
The summer box office is up a healthy 10.5% compared to 2017, according to comScore. The year-to-date total is also at an uptick, crossing $7 billion half way through 2018.

I bought a couple of cheap transducers from Amazon ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/Unknown-Bo...F8&qid=1532279645&sr=8-3&keywords=bass+shaker ), needed two as amp needs to see 8ohm.
Connected HDM on 1080ti to AV amp and shaker amp to on board speaker out.
The shakers are spaced and just behind the set on the base of the rig
All works fine using shakeit which come with Simhub. Very impressed with the cheap shakers
However I dont like using HDMI out as the system sees the AV receiver as another monitor which sometimes causes problems. So I popped to Currys and bought a USB sound car (No spare slots on mobo)
Again all works fine.
Now busy playing with frequencies and levels on the bass hsaker software.
Thanks for the help guys.

From the CNN news ne twork las t fall, they had this headline: B est things to do in Manaus  with these highlights:  A city of 1.8 million people surrounded by 2 million square miles of Amazon jungle more than 1,500 miles from Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, it doesn't get as many tourists as those two cities. Manaus is a gold mine of brightly colored architecture, riverfront views and world-class eating, minus the huge crowds. At the turn of the 20th century, Manaus was the center of a lucrative global trade in rubber. Today, it's the gateway for thousands of tourists seeking Amazon jungle adventures at the many lodges outside the city. 
For a key attraction we loved in Manaus, this article shared: ""Manaus' Amazonas Theater (aka Teatro Amazonas or simply The Opera House) is an opulent ode to the rubber boom of the 1800s when rubber barons and the local government had more money than they knew what to do with. Some of that windfall was used for the construction of the theater. It took 15 years to complete and includes tiles, stained glass and other elements brought from Europe.""

Because the device is so small, the probably had to amp up the bass to make up for the small drivers.
I heard the XEO bookshelf speakers and the Sound Stage was HUGE. Good clarity, a noticeable bass. The bass might have been a bit much, but they still sounded very good.

Even with Active Speakers, better to buy components.
Unless you specifically need USB-PC Connection then I would be inclined to simply add good Studio Monitors to the Wharfedale WXC-50.

There are many Studio Monitor to choose from in all sizes from 4"" up to 10"" - Mackie, KRK, Genelec, Focal, JBL, Adam, and yes even Dynaudio.

It is just a matter of determining how much money you want to pay.
The Dynaudio Xeo 6 are about £1800 to £2000/pr, that implies you could spend some serious coin on Studio Monitors.

However, Studio Monitors, while stunning at that price, are going to be Bookshelf and Wired.
Worth noting that the new XEO-30 Floorstanding is about £3200/pr -
http://www.bartlettshifi.com/product/dynaudio-xeo-30-wireless-active-speakers/
I think the XEO 6 had an original price of £2600/pr, making the current £1750/pr something of a bargain.
I suspect you could use the Yamaha WCX-50 to drive the Transmitter Box, and use that with the XEO 6 speakers. I would expect that to sound good, but it is up to you to listen to the speakers and see if they do what you need done. Overall though a pretty impressive speaker.
The XEO have the advantage of being wireless. That is sound is transmitted wirelessly from the Transmitter Box at the source to the Speakers. But ...just my opinion... if you can avoid wireless speaker connection, I would. However if it is demanded by your circumstances, then this might be a good option.

There is always going to be a slight downside to Wireless Speakers. You have to decide if that is a compromise you are willing to make.
There are other large Active Speakers, but they are Wired -

If you don't need intense bass, then many Studio Monitors with 6.5"" or 8"" bass drivers can sound excellent.
To some extent it depends on what your source of sound is - Computer, CD, Turntable, Network Player, TV, other . If a computer, then the Yamaha WXC-50 seems to solve that problem, simply Stream Audio.

There may be more cosmetic appeal to the XEO though.
The XEO are wireless NOT in the Network Wireless sense, they have simply eliminated the Speaker Wires.

I got mine at Ulta store. For some reason it's WAY more expensive on amazon's site.
I just bought this IT Cosmetics Your Most Beautiful You (without the brush) at Ulta. This is an amazing product and feels silky smooth, and good staying power. This is the moneymaker here. I hope that at some point they make the blush portion of this palette in an individual item. It's their best blush yet.
So for quick comparison between IT Cosmetics Your Most Beautiful You (blush portion), Nars Orgasm & IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Pores in Sweet Cheeks color:
IT Cosmetics Your Most Beautiful You (blush portion) is the BEST out of Nars Orgasm and IT Bye Bye Pores Sweet Cheeks. IT Your Most Beautiful you (blush) is just the right amount of peach/pink/gold ""sheen/luminosity"" and not glittery/or shimmery as Nars or IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Pores Sweet Cheeks (which this is the most glittery/shimmery out of the three). Your Most Beautiful You blush, is very similar in color as Nars Orgasm but WAY BETTER and has better color pigment, goes on very smoothly and stays on pretty well.
If you've ever had a love/hate relationship with Nars Orgasm but never seemed to get enough color payoff or you think its too shimmery/glittery, then look no further than this blush/highligher/bronzer palette.
As for highlighter portion of this palette, it is similar to IT Hello Light in Radiance, but more neutral in color, not as ""golden"" in color. I like the neutral tone in this palette, since I can use it as an eyeshadow under brow bone section and inner eye corner for some luminosity.
As for the bronzing portion of this palette, it's a not orangy. It's similar to Nars Laguna, but this palette bronzer is matte and slightly more ""warm"" in color.
Again, I hope IT Cosmetics makes and sells the blush portion as an individual blush and make a travel size portion of the palette (for your purse/traveling)."

Jokahontas/Boids on the Hood/Mighty Wakko at the Bat The Animaniacs take on Disney, The GoodFeathers take on Ralph, and Wakko takes on baseball. Plus, some bonus material! Joey Nathan and Kelly have a great time discussing this week’s episode.
Animaniacs TV Station Press Packet Thanks to our listener Mike Westfall, Joey managed to get his hands on some of the original material used to convince networks to air syndicated episodes of the Animaniacs. The hosts go through key sections including one dedicated to Steven Spielberg!
Animani-rats? Cold Open Animaniacs characters star in this farce of The Rugrats theme song. The hosts discuss all the appearances, and who each one represents. This segment of course leads to a discussion on the Rugrats reboot as well.
Jokahontas This segment is an obvious parody of pocahontas, but quickly expands to parody the disney heroine troupe and also on Mel Gibson in general. Joey Nathan and Kelly discuss their favorite moments and how they think it compares to last week’s disney parody, “Cutie and the Beast.”
Boids on the Hood Thaddeus Plotz has offended the wrong Pigeons, so the GoodFeathers take it upon themselves to attack his car in the way only pigeons know how to do. Ralph the Guard only makes it worse and ends up destroying the car trying to chase the GoodFeathers away.
Mighty Wakko at the Bat In this adaptation of Casey at the Bat, we get the whole Animaniacs cast trying to win a baseball game. It all comes down to little Wakko Warner to see if he can get the runs needed to win. Nathan, Kelly and Joey discuss their favorite moments from this segment.
Gag Credits Joey reads off the gag credits from the last ten episodes. As if that wasn’t enough, Nathan participates by saying something after each gag credit.

Hello My Jane Austen Book Club readers,
I’ve always enjoyed art, both the appreciation for the artist’s skill and patience involved, and as a form of creativity that (despite my poor attempts at painting) I find oddly soothing. Elinor Dashwood is one of Jane Austen’s heroines who is recognised for her artistic ability. Indeed, for young ladies of this time, skill with sketching or watercolours was considered an important accomplishment. For my latest inspirational Regency romance, Miss Serena’s Secret , I wanted to explore what it might be like for a young woman of artistic sensibilities in a time when young women were often seen as little more than a baby breeding machine.
This required research into Regency times where I learned some interesting facts. The Royal Academy of Arts was established in 1768 to encourage artistic excellence through education and exhibition by the likes of illustrious painters such as Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. But did you know two of their founding members were women? Angelika Kauffman and Mary Moser—both of whom had Swiss heritage—were active in the academy, exhibiting regularly at the Summer Exhibition at Somerset House, despite being subjected to elements of prejudice and notoriety. Women were often considered delicate and needing to be sheltered from certain activities in the world of art that others might consider scandalous. An interesting painting that depicts this is Johann’s Zoffany’s ‘The Portraits of the Academicians of the Royal Academy’ which shows the founding members (all male) studying a nude male model to determine his musculature to help understand how to paint the human body; Kauffman and Moser are depicted by their portraits on the wall, thus their modesty is protected. (Full disclosure: there are no nude male – or female - models in my book!) J There were many obstacles to women artists; a telling fact is that following the admission of Kauffman and Moser as founding members, no other women were admitted as full members until 1936!
In Regency times, visiting the Summer Exhibition in London was considered a must do for anyone with social aspirations – or even those with none. For the princely sum of a shilling, anyone could enter Somerset House and see the paintings line the walls, often four, even five paintings from floor to the ceiling. For artists, the opportunity to be one of those chosen to exhibit from the thousands of submissions was an immense honour, and could mean the hope of finances through further commissions; but for some, the thought of their artwork being ‘skied’ (placed up high near the ceilings) was considered insulting, and they would ask for their works to be removed. The place of honour was for a painting to be positioned at centre line, where people could best see it, and this was often saved for the VIPs of the day, such as the royals, or famous actors or generals such as the Duke of Wellington.
My artistic main character, Serena Winthrop , faces a number of similar challenges as she struggles to negotiate her creative passion with family and societal expectations. Added to this are her personal demons that suggest her pursuit of art might be a more viable option than marriage and child-bearing.

CAROLYN'S NEW BOOK, MISS SERENA'S SECRET, IS RELEASED ON JULY 24th 2018

About the Book
How can a wounded young woman ever trust a too-flirtatious earl with her heart?
With devastating scars in her past, Serena Winthrop is sure no man can be trusted—especially not a man like the too-smooth Viscount Carmichael. His reputation as a flirt and a gambler is everything she despises. And the young artist makes sure that this disreputable heir to an earldom knows of her deep disapproval whenever they encounter one another.
Henry, Lord Carmichael, is perfectly aware of his charms. He's gambled with plenty of ladies' hearts as easily as he has with their husbands' money. But lately he's wondered if there's more to life—and if his actions might prove unworthy of an admirable wife such as his friends have found.
When Serena's guardian asks his best friend to protect his young ward, Henry promises to be on his best behavior and not woo her. But the more he learns of her, the more he realizes she might be his best reason for changing his character.
Then the lady's art leads her to London infamy. Now Henry must choose between the life mapped out for him as the earl apparent and the love of his life. And Serena's secret may mean the end of his titled family line.
Miss Serena's Secret is part of the series Regency Brides by Carolyn Miller

Quote: : You can blame Mr Aaron Franklin. You know, the James Beard award-winning brisket guru whos restaurant is famed not only for its meat, but for the five hour lines. See, Aaron wraps his cooked briskets in paper to hold them during service, something he learned from his time with John Mueller who learned the technique from his own dad, Bobby, of Louie Mueller Barbecue fame. Two key things happened: Aaron and his barbecue got really, really, ridiculously famous, and he started using a pink/peach colored paper instead of the regular white one. This combo was all that was needed for folks around the world to get feverish over what is commonly referred to as peach paper. So lets take a look at exactly what it is, and why youd want to use it.

This morning was a very pleasant 8am wakeup from the girls, much better than for the others who had been picked up by receptions golf cart at 6am to get them to the Magic Express back to the airport. Looking out of the bedroom window we noticed that the large tree that had fallen next door had now been chopped up and removed, Disney really know how to clean up quickly!
Given that we had lots of credits remaining thanks to Irma, we headed to Olivias for breakfast (our first time eating real food there.) As we were seated the waitress asked if we had eaten here before, just a few times thanks to Irma!

Helen had a stack of pancakes, Evie of course chose Mickey Waffles, while I ended up going for the waitress recommendation of the banana bread French toast (which was absolutely amazing and without doubt the best breakfast I have ever had in Florida). Halfway through breakfast Evie tells us that I NEED A POO at the top of her voice, Im sure thats just what everyone wanted to know while they enjoyed their breakfast. Arriving with the bill the waitress asked if there was anything else she could help us with, but wouldnt take Imogen when I went to hand her over. I cant imagine why

Helen took the girls to return the DVDs and fill up our resort mugs, while I headed to the concierge desk in order to call Alamo. Fortunately extending the car wasnt too much work, and for a very reasonable $50 we were all sorted, and into the car and off to SeaWorld.
We arrived at around half 10 to an almost deserted park that had only reopened the day before. Naturally the only thing that was still closed with Manta, so sadly no chance to ride one of my favourite coasters this year.
Our first port of call was the stingrays, Evie was still a little too small to reach them easily but was incredibly excited when she finally managed to touch one.

The girls then headed off to the underwater viewing window to see the dolphins, while I headed over to the counter to book Helen and Evie onto the basic dolphin experience to make up for the experiences cancelled due to Irma (15$ each).

As it was nearly time for the only Shamu show that fitted our plan we headed there next, arriving about 20 minutes before the start of the show. After entertaining Evie with a phone while we waited, both girls really enjoyed the show with Imogen bouncing up and down on my lap the whole way through.

As we exited we offered Evie some ice cream, buying her some dipping dots from a stand near to Wild Artic. Of course she then decides that she doesnt want ice cream after all and refuses to eat it. Still, all the more for the rest of us! It did feel rather pricey at $7 for a standard tub, however this perception is probably down to actually having to look at the prices rather than just saying use a snack credit please.

It was nearly time for Blue Horizons, so we headed on round to the Dolphin Stadium (stopping en route to buy some water.) I was starting to get a bad headache and had managed to forget to pack any pills, fortunately we had Calpol for the girls so had to make do with that.

I am not a fan of the new dolphin show, it feels very preachy and has something of a lack of continuity to it compared with the old show. Helen on the other hand really enjoyed it, I dont think it held the girls attention nearly as well as One Ocean (however Evie did keep talking about it afterwards).
It was getting on towards lunch time, but as no one was particular hungry we ended up sharing a hotdog meal between the 4 of us. The fries were not salted, a nice change making them ideal for the girls (but rather bland for me!) While the large Coke was split between our Disney resort mugs which Helen had carefully thought to bring with us.

It was soon time for Helen and Evies dolphin experience, while in a spot of fantastic timing Imogen decided to have a nap. I wandered round to the viewing area and watched with the photographers. It was interesting talking to them about the hurricane while I was waiting for the experience to start, I hadnt realised just how limiting insurance was in Florida. Evie loved touching the dolphin and getting to see them up close, so we bought her the souvenir photo in a frame (35$).

Leaving the girls looking at the dolphins, I headed off towards Kraken to see what this new Virtual Reality setup is like. At least that was the plan, they have also introduced a digital queuing system Unlike the seamless process at Universal, at SeaWorld it just didnt seem to work so in the end I gave up and joined the girls in Antarctica.
Helen really wanted to see the penguins and was even prepared to queue for it, (very unlike her). The 10 minute wait posted for the non-ride version was very under estimated! As we queued the sky started to darken, but thankfully the heavens didnt open until after we got inside. We spent the queue talking to an American couple (Vietnam vet Major Bob and his wife Michelle), who were in front of us who had travelled up from the keys to avoid the hurricane and ensure they had electricity to power an oxygen generator.
Unfortunately they had been without power for 2 days post Irma, and were dependent on bottled oxygen from the hospital. They were at least fortunate in that Irma spared their island from the worst of the storm, and the reports from their son back at home was that the house was still standing. Very kindly they gave Evie coins to do a pressed penny on the way out.

After finishing with the penguins, we had pretty much achieved everything we had set out to do (other than the aforementioned issues with Manta and Kraken). So after a quick stop in the shops to pick up a couple of Christmas presents, we headed out of the park and drove to Premium Outlets.

The aim was to see if World of Disney had reopened, and to check the Lego prices in Toys R Us. I went on ahead to scout out the lay of the land, before returning to the car to collect Helen and the girls remembering the stroller this time , once I knew the shops we wanted were open.
World of Disney was not as good to us as it has been in prior years, coming away with a mug for Helen, some photo frames for the girls and a few Christmas decorations. Helen very nearly ended up with a new handbag before deciding the last minute that it wasnt quite what she was after.
Next it was over to Toys R Us, where the Lego was marginally cheaper than on Amazon at home. So we ended up with a swimming pool set for Evie, along with a large box containing a babies rollercoaster for Imogens birthday.
Getting in the car we realised that we were going to miss our ADR at Teppon Edo as we had lost track of the time. Arriving back at OKW we headed straight to the concierge desk, who fortunately had a friend in the restaurant and was able to adjust our ADR. We left the car at Hospitality House and took the bus straight to Epcot, before taking the boat across the lake to Morocco.
While we were waiting for the boat a number of fire trucks passed by close to Epcot, sirens and horns blaring. We never did work out what had happened. Evie and Imogen were kept entertained by an American girl while we were waiting. Talking to the mum they had moved into the Beach Club for a few days after their house in Orlando lost power. The family had the better end of the deal heading into the parks each day while her husband was shut in the hotel room working.
Reaching Teppon Edo we had around a half hour wait to be seated, naturally I was in trouble for insisting we continue with our ADR rather than just heading to Disney Springs like Helen had suggested. So it was approaching 8pm when we got into the restaurant, we loved the atmosphere (and for the first time had the restaurants manager come out to Helen in order to discuss her allergies). I ordered Helen a blood orange cocktail, which did the job distracting her from the late time for dinner.
https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4720/...e20bf9b0_k.jpg IMG_6734 (3) by Rich Pedder , on Flickr
I went for the steak and shrimp combo while Helen had the scallops, all were delicious and the entertainment having the food cooked in front of you was fantastic. I was less impressed by Evie deciding she needed me to take her to the toilet just as my steak finished cooking. Evie didnt eat a lot of her chicken, but loved the rice (and I think would have eaten a lot more if she hadnt been distracted by her toilet stop.)
Pudding was a ginger cake for me and a green tea cake for Helen (who had this down as being the best dessert of the whole holiday.)

All in all despite the long wait to get in, the meal was one of the highlights of the holiday and will definitely be on the list next time we go to Disney.
We left the restaurant shortly before Illuminations was due to begin, exiting the park just before the fireworks started. It felt very odd to be trying to avoid fireworks rather than the usual dash to find a good spot to view them, hopefully Evie starts liking them again soon.
https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4625/...44ca6dd8_k.jpg EPCOT_WSCJAPANICON_20170916_404882731517 by Rich Pedder , on Flickr
Soon we arrived back at OKW and picked up the car from Hospitality House stopping along the way at Conch Flats to use the first batch of snack credits on sample snacks to help decide how we would use the 50 odd remaining credits. Back in the room it was time for a beer and bed.
Tomorrow we are off to Discovery Cove."

Now that we were two weeks into the holiday, everyone was starting to get a little more relaxed. So after the previous two late nights we were in no rush to leave the villa, even more so given the plan for the day was a return to Hollywood Studios which we had visited the day before.
Thanks to Irma the plan for the week was in tatters, so we started the day off by writing a list of all the must dos that we wanted to achieve before the end of the trip. My brother had planned to get to Animal Kingdom for rope drop in order to get a final ride on FoP, however given he didnt leave the room until almost 9, he was in for another wait. Still, at least this time he would join the right queue
Given we had some free time before we were planning to head to the park, I took Evie into Disney Springs to buy some Lego Friends. As we arrived at Hospitality House we spotted a sign saying that the boats had not yet resumed service, fortunately a Disney Springs bus pulled into the stop literally as we saw the closure notice. We were unsurprisingly the only ones on the bus and soon arrived into Disney Springs. Unlike back at home, I really like the new bus lanes they have added around Disney Springs which really save time. Its about time they added them around the parks as well.
https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4698/...550dbc25_k.jpg IMG_6027 (2) by Rich Pedder , on Flickr
We arrived into Disney Springs about half an hour before the Lego store opened. Instead we headed to Starbucks to grab some breakfast, using some snack credits on a pumpkin spice latte and almond croissant for me and a biscuit for Evie. A long queue had formed outside the Lego Store, it turned out that the new UCS Millennium Falcon was released that morning. Unfortunately for those waiting they only had 20 available as most of the stock for Florida was trapped in Jacksonville due to Irma related floods.
After posing for some more photos with Stephanie and co we had a good look at the Lego Friends on offer, coming away with some small bag sets and the Lego Friends Vets. She also decided that she would like the hospital and Stephanies House for Christmas and her birthday respectively. Fortunately we managed to get a great deal on both via Amazon when we got home (I wouldnt have wanted to take those huge boxes on the plane.)
By now the boats had re-entered service, with a boat ready and waiting at the dock so we were soon on our way back to OKW. It was one of the more enjoyable boat trips for Evie, she spotted a massive fish swimming alongside the boat and was able to wave to Helen as we passed the room. As we arrived into the dock Captain Bob gave Evie some stickers and a boat card from the Disney transport series.
After meeting up with Helen and Imogen, we were soon enough we had boarded a bus and were on our way to Hollywood Studios, it was rather a strange journey with Harry Potter music playing the whole way almost like we were heading for Universal. Evie fell asleep half way to the park, and remained asleep as we transferred her into the stroller.

Arriving at the park we headed straight for the Frozen sing-along. A cast member was stopping everyone making us sit in the middle of a row. Strangely people were still trying to squeeze past to get to the far end despite the theatre being mostly empty, at least once all the expansions are complete we will stop being tempted to use a FastPass on this when it really isnt needed.
Evie took a little time to warm up, before spending the rest of the show singing her heart out. I liked the extra little touches from the cast It was a dark and stormy night no wait that was Sunday 

As we exited, Evie asked very nicely if we could have some popcorn. Helen ordered some and also asked if we could have a small empty cup in which we could decant a small amount for the girls, instead she handed Helen 2 full cups as well as the big carton she had ordered for a snack credit. It was just a shame I can't stand the stuff.
We next headed over to the Star Wars launch bay as Evie had asked if she could meet Chewie. Of course we got there and she decided that she didnt like him after all, nor was she overly impressed by BB8.

Exiting Star Wars we headed over to the Disney Junior character meets, starting with Doc McStuffins. We kept tricking Evie into joining the queues saying that Imogen wanted to meet them.

Before finally reaching Sofia  her favourite Disney Junior character.
While we were there I also stopped by to see Kylo Ren to gauge if I thought Evie might like something different, but thought better of it. Its a shame its not Vader to be honest

Next up was another flight on Star Tours, which was almost identical to our last flight. It was now almost time for our ADR at Mamma Melrose for an early dinner.

We had booked the Fantasmic package, so were able to have a starter, main course and a trio of deserts.
I went for the carne flat bread, while Helen went for the calamari, both were very nice but far too big for a starter. For our main course, Helen had the mai mai pasta and I went for the NY strip steak. Just like in 2016 the steak was very good. Finally was the desserts, with a blood orange cake, tiramisu and a cheesecake covered in those gel ball things.

Towards the end of the meal my brother managed to bump Evie's head with his elbow, prompting the response from Evie Uncle Simon you are in my bad books now while wagging her finger at him. After being handed our tickets for Fantasmic and settling the drinks bill, we headed back out into the park.

Our first target after dinner, was the Muppets,but it took a bit of convincing to get Evie into the building (despite loving the show each time she had been in previously). Eventually we were seated and Evie unsurprisingly really enjoyed herself.
Exiting the theatre Evie needed a quick toilet stop. As Helen and Evie exited the toilet, Helen holds up a pair of pants asking why these were still attached to Evie's (new) dress. Clearly I had not noticed them when dressing her in the morning

With so much closed a day at Hollywood studios ends up with a lot of repeat attractions, so next up was another viewing of Disney Junior Live. Evie really got into the spirit this time, singing along and shouting out the answers when prompted. She even managed to catch a shiny gold doubloon which made her day. Right at the end Imogen decided to put her new walking skills to good use and managed 4 steps in a mad dash towards the stage!

Looking at the wait times on the app, Toy Story Mania was only showing a 15minute wait so naturally we headed in that direction. At this point I went to put my phone back in my pocket, missed, and smashed the screen on the floor! I fully blame this as the reason why my brother managed to beat me on TSM when we made it over to the ride.

As we exited the ride the heavens opened as a thunder storm hit the park, with the rain lashing down we dashed into One Mans Dream (fortunately able to take the stroller in with the sleeping Imogen  a big thank you to that cast member!) After looking at the exhibits, we headed on round to the Guardians of the Galaxy area to meet Star Lord and Groot. In a repeat of Captain America last year, we currently have the second Guardians saved on the sky box but cant watch it as we still havent seen the first! After exiting the meet it looked like the rain had passed so we headed back out aiming to go over to Rock N Roller Coaster. The weather had other ideas with the storm returning with a vengeance moments later.

As Imogen had now woken up, we sheltered under the cover by the Little Mermaid while Granddad headed out into the rain in search of some food for her. The Brown Derby came to the rescue, handing over some bread (free of charge). By now the storm was right overhead and Evie was starting to get a little scared, so Nanny took her into the Little Mermaid which was about to start. Just before 8pm with the rain still hammering down we decide to call it a day, as it looked like there was no chance of Fantasmic going ahead.
https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4676/...a76e2eac_k.jpg IMG_6246 (2) by Rich Pedder , on Flickr
We arrived back into Old Key West to see more lightning flashing across the sky, so for once we had definitely made the right decision not to wait. Instead Evie was allowed to open up her new Lego Friends.
At this point we realised that despite all of the planning in advance of the holiday, I had managed to somehow make a colossal error on the plan. Somehow I had managed to list Discovery Cove a day earlier than we had booked it, compounded by the fact our early pickup of the hire car now resulted in it needing to be returned at 3pm.
Cue a rapid change to the plan, moving SeaWorld to tomorrow rather than Magic Kingdom and then Discovery Cove on day 16 (as booked) rather than SeaWorld (as planned). It would also mean calling Alamo in the morning to extend the hire car by 24hours.
As this was the others last night, it was time for farewells before their early departure, then off to bed.
Tomorrow: Magic Kingdom SeaWord"

The photo of the lad and two young girls kneeling and crouching just behind him went viral on social media with nearly 3,000 people sharing it. British Transport Police have confirmed they are making enquiries as part of an investigation. Tim Brown who took the photo and posted it on Facebook described the scene at Trowbridge railway station in Wiltshire on Saturday as ""absolutely unbelievable"". He said when he spoke to the adult the reply he got was that ""the trains not due"". Mr Brown, from Birmingham, added: ""When I pointed out there may be others ie freight, empties, unscheduled etc the reply was 'The next one's not till 16.38'.

My rating: 4 of 5 stars
Queenie Landry is currently working as an amusement park fortune teller but she used to be a physic adviser for the police with the love of her life Kirk Wallace until a case went bad and she steered the teams in the wrong direction leading to a woman''s death. It was then made so much worse when Queenie gives birth to a son but is in a coma sick only to wake up and discover he is dead. It appears an unknown person has been watching them and interfering in their (and other people's) lives. So when spiders start hanging around Queenie they are both stumped on what they want and what message they are trying to tell her. Can he work out what the message is and what it really means?
Lots of drama and danger in this story that centres around Queenie, Kirk and the unknown person. I loved the ending of the story that was very touching but I did find a little bit of the middle of the story a little boring in places. I loved the conversation with the unknown person and working out who it was and what they have done.

Welcome to Episode 274 of Observed Tech.
This week I kick off the show by trying to explain my screaming lobster analogy from last week’s episode about the changes in Windows 10 over the last three years. Hopefully, I helped and did not further muddy up the waters!
Then we had a quick rundown of Windows Insider and pre-release news of the past week including no client side fast ring build. That means the likelihood is high that we will see an update this week with a long list of updates since it will have been two weeks since Build 17713 was released to testers.
Big ticket item this week was Microsoft’s 4th Quarter FY-18 earnings that were announced on Thursday. Suffice it to say the demise of Microsoft is huge fake news!
Of course we have plenty of other news for you such as the release of a new Skype client for the Windows 10 desktop, a Costco variation of Surface Go, Amazon Prime Day results, and a few space news related items to wrap things up. So make sure you listen all the way to the end so you can catch everything.
As always enjoy the show and thanks again for listening! "

Ho pensato davvero questo qui mi sta chiedendo della zucca? – Pampii– Sorry?– Pompiii? Allora ho capito che o mi stava chiedendo di Pompei o era una proposta indecente. Mi son buttato sulla prima, così gli ho dato spiegazioni per arrivarci. Non sembrava convinto della mia risposta. Combinazione, a Pompei ci sono andato di sera, a teatro. Da solo. Credo bisognerebbe imparare a fare più cose da soli. Credo anche si debba disimparare a farlo perché poi ci si abitua troppo e non si sa più stare con gli altri. Avevo delle persone di fianco che commentavano ogni scena. Non conosco bene le regole del teatro non essendone frequentatore assiduo, ma sono quasi certo che si debba tacere durante la rappresentazione. Quelli che parlano durante gli spettacoli, di qualsiasi tipo siano, non li comprendo. Ero a vedere Nick Cave a inizio settimana. Mentre eseguiva una canzone al piano un tizio davanti a me faceva la traduzione simultanea delle parole a un amico. A voce alta. Un mio amico gli ha chiesto di non disturbare, la sua risposta è stata Ti sposti da un’altra parte se ti dà fastidio . Siamo una civiltà di egoisti. Se non ti sta bene vattene è la regola base della società. Poiché non volevo dormire con finestre ermeticamente chiuse (perché entrano le zanzare) e condizionatore spento (perché fa rumore) mi è stato detto Se non ti sta bene vai a dormire in auto . Ho reagito con stile. Fino a quando non ho dato un pugno a una porta e un calcio a una sedia e dedicato un paio di pensieri lesivi della dignità della Chiesa Cattolica. Fino a quel momento lo giuro che avevo avuto un ottimo stile. Ho un serio problema di gestione dello stress e dei nervi e non so come farvi fronte. Ho anche un problema di gestione dei libri. Ne ho perso uno. L’ho poggiato da una parte in mezzo alla campagna e l’ho lasciato lì. Spero venga considerato bookcrossing e che qualcuno ne abbia beneficiato. Non era neanche mio e l’ho riordinato su Amazon. Ho chiesto informazioni riguardo un annuncio di lavoro che avevo trovato su internet. Nell’introduzione si parlava di “ricerca personale per la sede di xyz”. Ho dedotto che fossero ricercati più profili: personale indica un gruppo di dipendenti. Non ho mai sentito parlare di un personale singolo. A meno che personale non fosse da intendersi come aggettivo: pssst questa è una ricerca molto privata . La mia deduzione era corroborata dal fatto che le attività che questo personale era chiamato a svolgere erano molteplici e variegate. L’unico mio dubbio è che nel descriverle ci si riferiva però a “la risorsa” al singolare. Ho chiesto quindi informazioni su quanti e quali profili stessero cercando. La risposta è stata: “Stiamo selezionando una persona che risponda al profilo indicato nell’annuncio”. Quindi loro stanno cercando una persona che: – Apra, chiuda la sede e si occupi del suo mantenimento ordinario– Gestisca volontari– Si occupi di amministrazione e contabilità e rendicontazione– Gestisca la comunicazione– Gestisca i rapporti con altri enti/istituzioni– Gestisca i rapporti con le altre sedi– Gestisca e aggiorni il database contatti– Si occupi delle risorse finanziarie Ho capito perché parlavano di personale: in effetti per seguire tutto ciò bisogna scindersi in più persone. Non ho ritenuto opportuno rispondere. Se ne è andato il mio Prof della tesi triennale e con cui ho fatto 2 esami e diversi seminari. Una persona eccezionale. Lo so che quando se ne va qualcuno sembra sempre un po’ retorico dire che fosse una persona eccezionale, ma se io lo scrivo è perché ne vale realmente la pena. È stata una settimana particolare.

On that day, the US stock market suffered a trillion-dollar collapse. Do you remember it?
In just 15 minutes from 2:45 pm, the Dow Jones plunged by almost 9 percent. Had it stuck, it would have been among the famous index’s biggest declines in a single day . Hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off the face value of famous companies in the S&P 500. Stocks in some companies were trading for a single cent.
Almost as soon as the sleepless Wall Street traders had time to adjust to the nightmare scenario unfolding in front of them, the market began to rebound. Within another fifteen minutes, almost all of the losses had been recovered.
It was one of those moments where you can only marvel at the absurdity of what it is to be a modern human. The numbers on the Dow Jones index are just numbers; the value they represent is, more than ever before, based on perceptions: stories we tell each other about companies and the economy.
Yet, had the trillion-dollar wipe-out proved permanent, there would have been real consequences, real layoffs, real suffering. Nothing of value was created or destroyed in the what became known as the “flash crash”; the markets weren’t responding to new information. We, collectively, have designed a system that is beyond our understanding, often beyond our control, and the unseen, intangible hands do not always serve us kindly.
The post-mortem for the flash crash was swift. Some people suspected insider trading, while others suggested technical glitches in the stock market might have been responsible. After five years, one man was charged with market manipulation: Navinder Singh Sarao, a 36-year-old from London who had been betting against the market with a “spoofing algorithm” around the time of the crash. He may have profited to the tune of $12 million. Small change against the trillion-dollar fluctuation.
Various outlets, including Bloomberg , have been skeptical that Sarao, who traded from his childhood bedroom in London, could really be held responsible for the flash crash. After all, while he was clearly no ordinary trader, the volumes of money he was moving around were tiny compared to the overall stakes of the flash crash. As it turns out, Sarao was also defrauded of the vast majority of his profits, and could not post his $5 million bail.
It’s an easier story to tell ourselves that one man’s misdeeds triggered the crash, because it allows us to believe that it’s a fixable problem. But even if you believe Sarao was solely responsible, it’s indicative of how vulnerable and chaotic the system is that his actions could trigger such a massive response.
A big part of the reason for this volatility is the sheer density of automated traders and algorithms that control these financial markets.
The most alert, savvy human is still limited by the speed at which his brain can process signals and move his muscles in response. Not so for an AI. In 2010, when Sarao’s algorithm helped trigger the crash, it was hardly alone: 70 percent of all trading activity was completely automated.
This represents a sea change in how trading is done on Wall Street. The classical idea is that the market tells you about investor confidence, and so what it reflects is information. If it’s widely known or anticipated that, say, Amazon is about to declare a record quarter of earnings, their stock will probably be riding high and reflect the value of that expectation.
In this classic system, the way you “win” and profit is by having access to information — or perhaps an expectation — that others don’t have, or by consistently making better judgement calls.
For an algorithmic trader, it’s different. Stories that contain rumors and hearsay are no good to an AI until they’re converted into a numerical value. At the classical end, algorithms might scan through news stories and the facts and figures of earnings statements to suggest new investment opportunities. They’re essentially doing the classical job of a trader, but many times faster. Natural language processing analyzes the sentiment of news articles and converts it into the AI’s “gut feeling.” If one understood the intricacies of the algorithm and the data it was being fed, one could hope to “game” this system with favorable stories in the media too.
At the more rapid edge, flash traders (sometimes called high-frequency traders, or HFTs), are searching for miniscule advantages. They’re not looking into whether Company A is more likely a better long-term investment than Company B, but instead seeking to profit from fluctuations in price that can take place over seconds or milliseconds, putting in thousands of orders for hundreds of stocks automatically in response to inflows of data. These are the people who built a $300 million cable that was ever-so-slightly straighter than the previous effort, to reduce trading times from 17 to 13 milliseconds — and made a killing in doing so.
In its most controversial form, the flash traders view orders from other market participants fractions of a second before the trades go ahead. The data that they’re feeding on isn’t information about the underlying stock, but about the market fluctuations caused by other people’s valuation of the stock. Predatory traders attempt to decode the signals made by one algorithm, while they attempt to conceal their intentions to avoid being scooped. It is this competition between fast and slow algorithms — and, possibly even attempts by the fastest algorithms to “outwit” the slowest — that helped lead to the flash crash. The algorithms, fed on a diet of each other’s behavior, are quite capable of whipping themselves up into a feedback frenzy without human prompting.
Previously, many of these algorithms used statistical models developed by quants, or quantitative analysts. Many used complex mathematics to convert streams of input data into a prediction of the future price of the stock, and therefore buying and selling instructions.
Now, increasingly, being able to run these models quickly is not enough, and hedge funds are turning to artificial intelligence that can improve its own models using Bayesian reasoning: it updates the model parameters depending on how successful the model has been.
Algorithms are not inherently bad; some have even argued that they stabilized the market during the flash crash more than humans might have done . Indeed, the system is likely so complex already that the only solution we can feasibly give echoes Facebook’s response to concern over use of its platform: smarter algorithms .
But the febrile cauldron of Wall Street is best suited to the worst excesses of algorithmic design and use. There is a huge incentive to make algorithms extremely powerful in decision-making, and avoid any semblance of transparency.
To “beat the market” — which now embodies not only everyone’s knowledge about stocks, but also the activity of the best algorithms that are being deployed — you need to have an edge that no one else has.
This inevitably leads to a lack of transparency. Bernie Madoff seemed to have an edge, generating remarkably consistent returns: it turns out his edge was running a multi-billion-dollar Ponzi scheme.
Every day, more and more impenetrable connections are added to this complex network, adding to the glut of inscrutable decisions. It is part of a broader trend, motivated by the undeniable advantages of efficiency and profit, to place more and more decisions and actions in the hands of black-box algorithms whose behavior is often unpredictable, inexplicable, and unquestionable, even as they become ever more deeply ingrained into the system.
As the flash crash warns us, the consequences of doing this without sufficient understanding can rapidly spiral out of control."

Coming up on Wall Street this week, we'll see earnings from Alphabet, Facebook, Twitter and Amazon. And you may want to clear your evening plans because Discovery Channel's Shark Week starts Monday.
Netflix has partnered with Sirius XM satellite radio for a 24-hour comedy channel, according to the Wall Street Journal. The streaming giant has made a major push to get into comedy by signing some of the biggest names in the business to major contracts, including Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, Ellen DeGeneres and more. The new Sirius XM channel is expected to go live in January 2019.
And ""Star Trek"" alum George Takei has a new project. The actor is working to bring attention to the Trump administration's border separation policy and Muslim travel ban with a new app called ""House of Cats."" Takei stopped by Cheddar to tell us more about it."

I read Captain Marvel comics back in the 70's, watched the t.v. show, had the ""New Beginning"" mini, and collected Power Of Shazam in the 90's and I was excited to hear that Johns was bringing Cap back in the New52 and thought about picking the book up. But reading descriptions of the book, and having paged through a copy, snarky Billy was just too jarring for me.
But unlike too many ""fans"", I realize that I'm no longer the target audience, nor do I assume that what I like or prefer would capture the imagination of millions of people. Especially the imagination of kids of today. That would be stupid.
But then, I've always felt that Captain Marvel should never have been integrated into the DC universe proper, and should've been left in his own light hearted and poking fun at superheroes universe the way C.C. Beck intended him to be. Click to expand... I just checked the rating for Geoff John's Shazam and apparently you guys are in the minority, because it has 4.5 stars with 150 ratings on Amazon, 4.05 with 1,550 on Goodreads and 5 stars with 291 ratings on Comixology.

My Galaxy S9 didn't offer the opportunity for cache manipulation as S6 had but I was able to uninstall my affected browser (Chrome) and replace it. Then I was poking around to find that I could stop the auto sync and reset the sync options to delete history and other settings like autofill and such. I kept my bookmarks and pswds and didnt sync anything else. I have no idea yet what I may have overdeleted but at least I can now use my browser again without the ""opportunity"" to play an ""Amazon"" game from which there is no escape.

You don’t need a TV Licence to own or possess a television set. However, if you use it to watch or record programmes as they are being shown on TV or live on an online TV service, or to download or watch BBC programmes on demand, including catch up TV, on BBC iPlayer, then you need a TV Licence in order to do so.

The only thing I've noticed is that the TV still has to support 240p through the component or the picture will bounce around. It doesn't upscale or anything but it doesn't seem to add any perceptible lag.

Some of this I knew, but for some I required a reminder.
Inadequate sleep affects
Blood sugar levels, raising the level to a prediabetic state Arteries, creating a recurser to coronary disease Psychiatric states, enhancing conditions like depression Motor skills creating problems similar to DUI “So if you’re fond of saying, “I’ll sleep when I’m dead”, well, that may be happening a lot faster than you anticipated.”(1)
Eight hours are required for memory and brain skill development and to enable the brain to come to grips with problems encountered during the day. In turns out that the phrase, “sleep on it”, is factual and useful in discussing how to resolve a problem.
Quoting from Walker’s Why We Sleep ,
REM-sleep dreaming offers a form of overnight therapy. That is, REM-sleep dreaming takes the painful sting out of difficult, even traumatic, emotional episodes you have experienced during the day, offering emotional resolution when you awake the next morning.(2)
Sleep is when the brain sorts out messes, “takes out the trash” and otherwise prepares you for the next day.
The phrase “beauty sleep” is also real.
What’s required for sound sleep:
Eight hours — no less or more. Too much is as much a problem as to little. Soft lighting in the hours before sleep and no light in the bedroom. Any light can reduce melatonin release that occurs during sleep. Blue light is the worst, but any is bad. No caffeine for 10-12 hours before bed. No alcohol or sleeping pills before bed. Both have an amnesia effect, causing people to forget what they learned during the day. They also create an artificial form of sleep without the benefits of real sleep. Cool room temperature for sleeping. If you have chronic insomnia, pills aren’t the answer. The article recommends sleeping less, which will induce fatigue that allow you to get a sound sleep. You cut back to five hours of sleep, and then gradually increase the time until you reach eight hours. Good to remember, good to do.
As I read more on this topic, I’ll add to this post.

I got my Instant Pot a couple of years ago through a deal on Amazon Prime Day. I was very skeptical about this new “fad” and wasn’t sure if adding another gadget to my kitchen was really going to make life easier. After using it for a while now, I am definitely sold. And not only am I sold, I have also been touting its benefits to my friends.
I met one of these friends recently and he did not hesitate to point out that I have not posted any recipes using the Instant Pot. So, here is my first Instant Pot recipe. You can adapt this to a pressure cooker or rice cooker easily.
We had a few friends over for dinner a couple of weeks ago. It was a chaat party - sooji dhokla, cocktail idlis, dahi balla, jaal muri, ragada patties, and vegetable pulao. I added the vegetable pulao, because I felt that just serving snacks may not be enough (I can see my husband rolling his eyes at me)
Anyway, since I did not want to make anything else to go with the pulao, it needed to be a standalone dish. I have made variations of this pulao on several occasions and it has never failed me.
This is a great dish to make for parties or for a quick weeknight one-pot dinner for your family.
Instant Pot Recipe: Vegetable Pulao
Prep. time: 10 minutes (not including soaking time for rice) Cooking time: 20 minutes Serves: about 4 - 6 as a meal, about 10 - 12 as part of a bigger spread
Here’s what you need: 2 cups basmati rice, soaked in water for about ½ hour 2 green chilies, diced 3 cloves garlic ½” piece ginger 3 tsp. ghee 1 tsp. cumin seeds 2 - 3 star anise 1” piece cinnamon 1 - 2 bay leaves 5 - 6 cloves 2 green cardamom pods 1 tsp. black pepper, crushed ½ large onion, diced 1 medium potato, peeled and diced into tiny cubes 1 carrot, diced a handful of frozen green peas salt to taste 1 tsp. cumin/coriander powder ½ tsp. chili powder ½ cup yogurt 3 ½ cups water a handful of chopped cilantro
Here’s how I made it:
Using a mortar and pestle, and crush the green chilies, garlic, and ginger to a coarse paste. Set aside Turn on the instant pot to sauté mode. Add ghee. When the ghee gets hot, add the whole spices. After about 30 - 40 seconds, add onions. Sauté for a few minutes till the onions turn translucent Add the diced veggies, peas, salt, and chili powder. Mix well Add yogurt. Mix well and cook for a minute. Drain the rice and add to this mixture. Add water. Check the salt - it should taste a bit salty. Turn off instant pot and turn it back on in rice mode. Mine turns on for 12 minutes Cover and let it cook. Unplug the instant pot when the cooking time is done and let the pressure release on its own. Fluff with a fork.
Serve with papads and raitha "

Accordingly, in our vision plan for EbixCash with respect to the area of Lending, we see three opportunities: one - powering the technology for Lenders in any industry; two – creating a person-to person lending exchange that can be available over the web, e-wallets, mobile phones, white label Corporate intranets and EbixCash outlets to consumers; three – lending services for our EbixCash outlets that allows them the power to borrow and expand their business with EbixCash. The acquisition of Indus is a step in the direction of accomplishing the first step of that vision plan.” “Indus provides us now with the ability to interface a Person to Person (P2P) Lending exchange into the back-end systems of top lenders in the market place and move data seamlessly across front-end and back-end systems. This will also allow Indus clients to access the 260,000+ physical distribution expanse of EbixCash, along with our strong corporate and electronic network, and be a lending provider to our vast consumer network in India, through a future EbixCash P2P Exchange.” Robin added, “Indus also fits in well with our goals of expanding the EbixCash network globally, since it provides us with an international customer base across Europe, Middle East and South-East Asia.” Louis Hernandez Jr., founder, managing director and CEO of Black Dragon Capital, said, “We’re very proud of the work we have done with the Indus team to create a high-growth and profitable company that is a perfect fit for Ebix’s performance driven and growth culture. Ebix is acquiring outstanding talent and a clear market leader with a global brand and distribution, that will help further its growth while adding to Ebix’s comprehensive product suite. It’s great for the customers, employees and partners at Indus and is very exciting for everybody. Overall, Black Dragon Capital accomplished what it does best, which is to help a company accelerate its growth.” Leadership in India’s Financial Exchange markets The addition of the Indus to the EbixCash portfolio further strengthens Ebix’s leadership in India’s Financial Exchange markets: EbixCash already has a dominant leadership position in the inward remittance exchange arena in India. EbixCash is already the largest domestic remittance exchange in India with domestic remittance volume of approximately $100 million per month. EbixCash is seen as a leader in the outward remittance and Forex markets, with Forex counters in 25 international airports, besides a vast network encompassing 165 outlets spread across 55 cities, 200+ franchisee partners, 2,000+ travel agents, 50+ banks and financial institutions, 1000+ SMEs, and 150+large corporate clients. EbixCash through its travel portal Via.com is one of South East Asia’s leading travel exchanges with over 110,000 distribution outlets and 8000 corporate clients, processing over 24.5 million transactions every year. EbixCash is also a recognized leader in prepaid cards, domestic remittances and bill payments, processing approximately 600,000 transactions per day and approximately $2 Billion in annual payment volume. EbixCash is already recognized as a leader in the Gift card space with brand gift cards across all categories with 100+ Brand copartners like Amazon, Flipkart.com, Croma, Lifestyle, Big Bazaar, Tanishq, BookMyShow.com, Reliance Digital, MakeMyTrip.com, Café Coffee Day, Pizza Hut, Myntra.com, Pantaloon etc. EbixCash is a leader in the utility payment space serving as a payment exchange for large utility providers like BSES, Tata Power, NDPL, Reliance Energy and Mahanagar Gas etc. Ebix’s recent joint venture initiative with Bombay Stock Exchange positions it as a gateway for insurance carriers to sell insurance to India’s vast population through EbixCash’s tens of thousands of phygital outlets across the country, besides BSE’s strong network across the country."

It’s great for keeping with you for use after long periods of stress, whether that’s work, driving or overseeing children.

On first seeing the Lyapko Facial Roller, it may bring forth ideas of medieval torture. However, all those spikes actually work to fight wrinkles, improve blood circulation and produce more radiant skin. And while it may appear to provide a painful, needle experience, each head is faceted so that your skin experiences no damage during use. Plus, the Lyapko Acupuncture Facial Roller comes in a variety of sizes so you can choose what’s best for you. "

I have a spare LPS-1 (after upgrading to the LPS 1.2) which I use to power it - 5v/1A
The Toslink cable supplied with the Dave goes from the convertor to the Dave. All upsampling is turned off, so it’s just plain vanilla Red Book into the Dave. It sounds glorious and much better than BNC Blu 2 to Dave. I’m afraid the interface between the RFI generated by the BLU 2 and Dave’s ground plane is a major issue for me.
I accept, this is a rather odd arrangement, and probabably not for anyone apart from an oddball like me. I now have two optical sources into the Dave — the above and and Aries Mini for Tidal, and battery USB, an IsoRegen with LPS-1.2 battery power supply. All sound good to me. Click to expand..."

My Free Life
Necie Navone
Publication date: July 16th 2018
Genres: Adult, Romance, Suspense
Freedom. Something the majority of the people on this Earth enjoy. Something I’ve never had. Something I want more than anything. When I left for University, I thought my life wouldn’t be quite so tragic… Ha! I am now the Capo Donna, in charge of the Family and its businesses located in Northern Italy. The power struggle between me and my Papa, the Capo, comes to a head when some of my closest friends find themselves caught in a dangerous situation. In order to save them, I have to let that switch inside me flip, the one I hate, in order to be what they need me to be to save them. The monster my Papa insisted I become, the one he can no longer control. The assassin. The side of me I fear will destroy my soul if I can’t escape from this Family… This Life. Will I ever be able to wash this blood off my hands? Can I ever be absolved of the lives I’ve taken? This is the final straw. As friends and loved ones begin finding their Happily Ever Afters, I know it’s time to escape. They’ll all be fine. They have their One and Only’s. It’s time for me to be Free… so I can find my own.

So I got my Amazon Echo Show this week, and well i'm loving it, however I found about 2 glitches so far. 1 of them was the touchscreen. it works however when I clicked a programme it never worked. I could drag it along but clicking it wouldn't play it. I had to unplug it and plug it back in for it to work. Another small glitch I found was the speaker, it made a small crackling noise for about a second but when to normal afterwards.
Any reason why im getting these issues?
 Hello MatthewW191!
Hopefully these were one-off issues that resolved themselves when you restarted it - which is the best way to resolve intermittent problems. If either of these issues persist, I would start by making sure your Show is on the latest update (611499020). You can check by going to Settings (Swipe down, or say Go to Settings) then Advanced Options > Check for Software Updates .
Keep us posted, and welcome to the forum"

Here is a direct link to the single Amazon Help Page that instructs you how to implement Family Library, which I assume you read through in order to do it:
Amazon Help Page - Family Library
As it states (about 4 times I think) on the page as a warning:
""Note: If a linked Amazon account is removed from or leaves your Amazon Household, neither adult will be able to link another adult account or join another Amazon Household within 180 days. ""
As others have advised, it may be that the Amazon Help Desk staff may be able to assist you if you ask them, but they may not be able to change the rules if it's set in stone in the computer I'm afraid :(

Get out of that same ol’ recipe rut and try one of these delicious and easy recipes this week! This week I highly recommend making Sandwiches and the Chicken Barbacoa Wraps with Black beans, corn and avocados !
Oh Sunday how I’m so happy to see you. This past week has been A BEAR! So our realtor and drone/photography guy is scheduled to come to the house this Thursday to take aerial shots and also create 360 videos for our house and property to FINALLY LIST IT! Needless to say we’re in super crunch mode to tidy up the last bit of stuff which, well isn’t small. I spent hours planting/mulching/weeding, got 483 bites while working outside, moved rocks, ran a 100′ auger-thing (with Mr. Fantabulous) to unclog our pipe to our creek-fed pond, cleaned out several closets and worked almost all day in our pool house cleaning it. Today is all about cleaning the pool and capping off the water level.
Oh yeah – and work on 3 recipe shoots plus make us food! BUT… providing the weather holds, we will officially have pictures taken market! It’s almost surreal ya know? This has been such a long, LONG process for us. 9 years… 9 long, grueling, almost ended our marriage, years. Yes, it almost ended us to be honest. What we took on was no simple task and most definitely not small. It wasn’t a room or something small but it was literally the entire house plus 5 acres. But in the end, honestly, it made us stronger. We joke that every couple should go through what we did as it pushed us both to our limits but in the end, love prevailed.
So many of you email me or comment about how we’re doing so much work on the house, for so long only to sell it. That it just doesn’t make sense. I get what you’re saying and honestly the house wasn’t in bad shape at all. It was just dated downstairs with the half brick wall/half 18″ cedar walls in the media/billiard room, berber carpeting throughout and drop ceiling. It was just dark.
What started out as just a single room update and ‘ just 3 months honey, that’s all it’ll take me!’ remark led to 9 years and almost an entire whole house remodel. We got in over our heads and once we took down the brick/cedar/ceiling did we realize just how exponential the project grew. I thank God every day I married the man I did because of his mastery and expertise we were able to do the work ourselves. Just a lot, A LOT, of blood, sweat, tears (many tears), arguments and even laughter went into make this house truly something magical for the next owner. ‘So why not stay?’ most will ask. Honestly, I’m ready for a change; we both are. We both want to start a new chapter in our lives elsewhere though I’ve told him repeatedly that he is not allowed to take a single tool when we move – he can have duct tape and a glue gun and that’s it! I will never, EVER go through this again.
This house, whomever buys it, will want for nothing and will have a dream house. Part of me wishes that when we sell, that we could take it with us as it’s that amazing but it’s time to close that chapter of our lives.
So… wanna buy a house? *smile* Amazon Prime Day
Did many of you experience the pages of ‘oops!’ dogs on Prime day? It was terrible for me as that’s all I got the majority of the time. I actually felt bad for Amazon as I know what it’s like when your website gets so much traffic that the servers can’t handle it. For those that did get in, did you get any food finds? I’ll just save my money for “Black Friday” as that’s when their sales are amazing! Travel
With us working on the house so much I doubt that we’ll take a vacation this summer. Did you go anywhere? I’ve been thinking a lot lately that this Fall/Winter that I’d like to maybe go to Iceland (have you been?) and maybe on a cruise. I know I have a few press trips coming up in the Fall but that’s work and while they are fun (so love them!), I think I need a real vacation. Last week on Instagram
If you’re on Instagram let’s connect! I often post behind the scenes videos and food shots of stuff I’m working on plus I have lots of IGTV videos up there! I’m @thekitchenwhisperer
So last week I was busy in the house and honestly still have no clue how I found time to cook let alone create! I FINALLY took real photos of this dish so let me edit them and I’ll post the recipe soon! Just let me get through the last bit of house stuff first! A post shared by Lori Monte (@thekitchenwhisperer) on Jul 15, 2018 at 8:13am PDT
And then there’s this… when it’s cheat day and you just want to get downright nasty. Make sure your sound is on when you play the video! A post shared by Lori Monte (@thekitchenwhisperer) on Jul 15, 2018 at 4:03pm PDT

A Virginia-based political campaign and robocalling company Robocent left hundreds of thousands of voter records on a public, exposed and unprotected Amazon S3 bucket. This year has already seen a lineup of attempted attacks on local elections and campaigns, but this news comes less than a week after the indictment of 12 Russian officials for meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.
According to an 18 July blog post by Bob Diachenko, head of communications at Kromtech Security , Robocent’s self-titled bucket was reportedly ""indexed by GrayhatWarfare , a searchable database where a current list of 48,623 open S3 buckets can be found. Repository contained both audio files, with pre-recorded political messages for robocalls dials (*.mp3, *.wav), and voter data (*.csv, *.xls files).""
Voter names, phone numbers, addresses, age, gender, jurisdiction breakdown and political affiliation were some of the information included in the data, which Robocent co-founder told ZDNet was publicly available information that the company was only ""keeping track of.""
“Voter data is extremely sensitive and leaks like this highlight the need for organizations to maintain visibility into where their data is located within their cloud infrastructure and whether the storage system is risk appropriate given the sensitivity of the information. It’s easy for a fast-growing or seasonal organization like this one to lose track of that risk over time,” said Sam Bisbee, CSO, Threat Stack .
“Many companies have critical AWS cloud security misconfigurations. It’s an easy mistake to make. AWS customer needs to take responsibility for their security by prioritizing infrastructure visibility. Find ways to proactively create transparency within the cloud to effectively manage the security of data and systems and you give your organization the best chance of defending itself against cybercriminals.”
The security of the 2018 midterm elections is a growing concern, which makes the lack of proper cybersecurity hygiene through virtually all job roles within the election ecosystem, private and public, problematic for security, said Ben Johnson, CTO and co-founder, Obsidian Security .
“Given this abysmal state of election security, one has to assume that any voter data that hasn’t already leaked soon will,” Johnson said. “Companies, campaigns and individuals are all racing to collect and utilize data without doing nearly enough to properly safeguard it. When you combine poor practices with lucrative data and motivated, sophisticated attackers, this picture will get worse before it gets better.” Why Not Watch? "

Based on their successes in the book and streaming businesses, the company certainly has the experience to do just that, but many are voicing their outrage at turning community-friendly centers into what would be just another corporate landmark.
Amazon Books is a chain of bookstores that does what Amazon originally intended to do; replace the local bookstore. It improves on the bookstore model by adding online searches and coffee shops. Amazon Go basically combines a library with a Starbucks. At the core, Amazon has provided something better than a local library without the tax fees. This is why Amazon should replace local libraries. The move would save taxpayers money and enhance the stockholder value of Amazon all in one fell swoop."

Hello MIUIers,
If you’ve only ever installed apps from the Google Play Store on your Android device, you’re missing out on a whole world of new apps. Unlike iOS, Android allows you to install apps from anywhere—this is called sideloading. Whether you’re an Android beginner or veteran, sideloading is useful to know. We’ll walk you through the process of finding third-party apps, how to sideload those apps, and some safety concerns you should be aware of.
What Is Sideloading?
Sideloading is the process of installing a file on your Android device from sources other than the Google Play Store. This article is specifically about how to sideload apps, but you can also sideload other media on Android. Sideloading apps involves downloading an APK file (Android’s installer package format) and running it manually.
Android’s open nature means that you’re generally free to install apps from wherever you see fit. If you don’t like Google Play, you can install an alternative Android app store like F-Droid or the Amazon Appstore. But since Google doesn’t let you download those app stores from Google Play, you’ll need to download them elsewhere.
Why Would I Want to Sideload Apps?
One of the biggest reasons for sideloading is accessing apps that aren’t available on Google Play. Most aren’t hosted there due to breaking the Play Store’s terms of service. For instance, Amazon’s Appstore and the Humble Bundle aren’t available because they download other apps. Others, like YouTube alternative client NewPipe, add new features to YouTube that Google isn’t fond of. But these apps are still safe, and offer benefit to you. Or perhaps you want a Google-free phone. Part of that is avoiding Google Play, so you can sideload your apps instead. Whatever your reason, sideloading is a key feature of Android you should know how to do.
How to Enable Sideloading on Android
Before you actually sideload a file, you’ll need to enable the feature. For security, Android prevents you from installing apps that come from outside Google Play. This prevents you from inadvertently installing a malicious file, but you can override it.
The process for doing so depends slightly on your version of Android. If you don’t plan to sideload often, for safety we recommend turning this setting off after installing your app.
Enable Sideloading on Android 7.x Nougat and Older
android-unknown-sources.png (100.55
In older versions of Android, sideloading is an all-or-nothing toggle. You simply need to flip a switch to enable installing apps from anywhere. To do so, head to Settings > Security. You’ll see an entry on this page labeled Unknown sources. Toggle this on, and your phone will display a warning that your device is more vulnerable to attack with this setting on. We’ll discuss this shortly; tap OK to accept it for now.
Enable Sideloading on Android 8.x Oreo and Newer
Android-Special-App-Access-Oreo-335x596.png (50.56
3.png (42.38
On newer versions of Android, Google made a change to sideloading to increase security. Now, you must toggle the Unknown sources option per-app instead of globally. This allows you to install from certain apps you often use while keeping others blocked.
To toggle this, open Settings > Apps & notifications. Expand the Advanced section at the bottom and tap Special app access. On the resulting menu, scroll down and choose Install unknown apps.
You’ll see a list of apps on your device that have the capability to install other apps. Select the one you want to install apps through, such as your browser, cloud storage, or file explorer. Then enable the Allow from this source slider.
Sideloading Can Be Risky: Security Concerns
Before we continue, it’s important to discuss a few security matters about sideloading. By installing apps on your device that don’t come from Google Play, you’re potentially opening your phone up to problems. While Android malware isn’t a massive issue out of the box, the easiest way to introduce malware is through installing shady and/or dangerous apps.
Thanks to Google Play Protect, all the apps on Google Play are (theoretically) safe. That’s not the case when you’re downloading from the wild west of the internet. To stay safe, you should only download from trusted sources. APKMirror is a well-known resource for downloading APKs. You can also download APKs from Google Play. But we don’t recommend getting apps from random APK sites, as there’s no guarantee of safety. You should also avoid installing “cracked” apps (paid apps that are illegally distributed for free). There’s a much greater chance of picking up an infection through them.
How to Sideload Apps on Android
The actual process of sideloading apps is pretty easy. We’ll cover the three most popular methods below. Note that apps installed from outside Google Play won’t receive automatic updates (apps from APKMirror are an exception). You’ll need to check the third-party app store for updates or download them manually.
Method 1: Install APKs Directly on Android
2.png (55.83
You can sideload apps directly from your browser on Android. Simply open a page that offers APKs and download it. You’ll see a warning that the APK can harm your device; tap OK to proceed. Once it downloads, you’ll see a little banner with a shortcut to open it. Tap Open and you can install the app. If you miss it, you can tap the Download notification or open your Downloads app to reach it. Once installed, just open it like any other app and you’re good to go.
Method 2: Install APKs on Android Through Cloud Storage

If you find your phone’s browser inconvenient for this task, the next-best way is using cloud storage. This lets you download a large amount of apps using your PC, then install them on your phone from all in one place. We recommend creating a dedicated folder for APKs in Dropbox, Google Drive, or whatever other storage you use. Drop files in that folder whenever you come across them on your PC. Then on your phone, open the corresponding app and browse to that folder. Tap an APK file, and you’ll see the same prompt to install it. Make sure you’ve given the cloud storage app permission to install apps if you’re on Android Oreo or newer.
Method 3: Install APKs on Android via USB Transfer

This is the least convenient method, but it still works if you don’t want to use the above for whatever reason. Download the APKs you want to install onto your computer. Then plug your phone into your computer with a USB cable. You may need to tap the notification on your device and change the connection type to Transfer files if your computer doesn’t detect it.
Open This PC and transfer the APK files onto your device. It’s a good idea to create a new folder to keep them all in one place. Transfer them, then you can disconnect the cable. (If you prefer, you can also connect your phone to your PC through Bluetooth and transfer the files that way.) To install your apps, open your Android file explorer and browse to the folder with the APKs. Tap on each to install them, which results in a screen just like installing from a browser.
You’re Now Ready to Sideload Apps on Android
Now you know the essentials of downloading and installing APKs on your Android device. Enabling it and installing the apps is the easy part—it’s most important to make sure you stay safe while doing so. Remember to only install apps from trusted locations.

Hello MIUIers ,
It may not be something you think about on a daily basis, but it’s an important question nonetheless — why are most voice assistants female? Is this a conscious effort from companies, or is it just a standard that everyone blindly follows?
The answer depends on the voice assistant in question. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos famously stated that the idea behind its virtual assistant was to recreate the Star Trek computer, which had a woman’s voice. Microsoft, on the other hand, performed extensive research and found that a majority of customers preferred female voice assistants to male ones.
Times are a-changin’, and we’re starting to see companies give us more voice options (finally!). You can now choose between eight different Google Assistant voices, including both high- and low-toned male and female voices. Siri lets you choose between male and female voices too, as well as a number of different accents.
This is no doubt a positive change, and one that’s happening for a reason. In a recent NPR interview, LivePerson CEO and EqualAI leader Robert LoCascio argued that we need to consciously decide what voices we include with each voice assistant, and how those decisions affect our lives. He noted that children are susceptible to picking up the way you’re “supposed” to talk to voice assistants, and that it could have a negative affect on how we talk to women.
If you talk derogatory to an Alexa, children pick this up. They go back to school and they think this is the way you talk to someone and this is maybe the way you talk to women.
This is one of the reasons companies are including male, female, and gender ambiguous voices. Allowing users to choose which voice they connect with the most is a win-win for everyone — users feel a more personal connection to their assistants, in turn pushing them to use them more.

We opted to pay for the international plan on ATT. It was 60 bucks a month but unlimited texting which she used a lot. A small amount of data that helped in a crunch. Discounted minutes of talk for when she had to call a hotel or something. It was nice for her because it moved easily between the 10 countries she visited without changing her SIM card or interruption in service. Certinaly there are cheaper ways though."

My wife met her in Thailand and brought back a lot of her stuff, half way though her trip. She lived with locals during her stay. She liked it so much she took off spring term and back packed through Vietnam, Cambodia, Loas for an extra 2 months. She admits she had way too much stuff with a suitcase, and backpack.
She applied for the critical language program through the State Department and is currently back in Indonesia for an intensive again living with a local family.
This time... Well.. Back to REI.... They will take back her back pack she used for full refund up to 1 year and she got a larger 50 cu ft Osprey back pack. She has a smaller day pack and that's it!!! She is there for 2 months. She can buy some extra clothes in the markets there (let your daughter know she's going to want to go shopping there.. Hint...) So less is more. Again my daughter traveled around even during her first semester in Indonesia but left the bulk of her stuff with her host family. Packing tip :my daughter used these plastic compressible bag things to really compress your clothes tight and fit more stuff. Got them on Amazon.
What's app and messenger for free calls. T-mobile with free international but actually what's app worked better for her. She got Sim cards at the airports when she landed. They are very cheap. Yes getting a cheap phone works. My daughter's Samsung phone crashed on her and she picked up a iPhone 5 for cheap in Indonesia and it works great. She uses this when she was back also. She doesn't like a lot of features on her phone. Data is usually cheap and using wireless is free so don't pay large monthly bills either way.
All the above suggestions are great from others. We made her multiple copies of her passport etc so she would have copies incase something got lost plus a copy on her phone and clouded. We of course had copies. She is now with the state department so they actually have the passports etc.
She had to also get certain a medications to have with her incase she got typhoid fever etc. Of course she never got sick except for the initial transition from being in a different country Imodium anyone... Lol
Again less is more... She doesn't need her entire closet. One nice pair of shoes if there are events that require that, or nice casual ones, gym shoes and sandals. Done! A week's or two worth of underwear. She will have means to washer /""dryer correct. A few clothes that she can combine into different outfits that way only women can do... Ha T-shirts and blouses. Etc. Read some blogs on traveling . They all agree.... Less is more.
My daughter is so much happier taking less this time around."

Google has announced it is constructing another private subsea cable. Set to enter service in 2020, it will cross the Atlantic Ocean from Virginia Beach in the US and stretch almost 4000 miles to the French coast.
While the Dunant cable, which is named after the founder of the Red Cross and first recipient of the Nobel Prize, Henri Dunant, will land in France, it connects Google’s North Virginia region directly to its Belgium region.
“Dunant adds network capacity across the Atlantic, supplementing one of the busiest routes on the internet, and supporting the growth of Google Cloud,” wrote Google’s strategic negotiator of global infrastructure, Jayne Stowell.
As Google owns Dunant, which will be the first trans-Atlantic cable solely owned by a non-telecom company, it can be connected directly to the firm’s data centers and means Google doesn’t have to share bandwidth with any consortium partners. This gives it an advantage over the likes of Microsoft and Amazon, who use consortium cables to transfer data across the Atlantic.
Dunant, which is expected to have a lifespan of 15 to 25 years, is the fourth privately-owned Google cable. The first two run over relatively short distances, while the third, Curie, connects Los Angeles and Chile and will go into operation next year.

When finishing a book, on my Fire 10, I have the option of leaving a Goodreads review from the ""Before You Go"" page. I've disabled the option of posting an Amazon review. But even though I've disabled the Amazon option, I'm still expected to abide by bizarre rules that every review must have a Heading/Subject and that the review must be a minimum of 20 words.
I say bizarre because Goodreads has no such restrictions on posting reviews via the web or their app. If those are the requirements for posting Amazon reviews, then they need to be lifted when posting to Amazon has been disabled in the options. I like to immediately rate the book and add a few words about it. I might revisit the review later (with a browser or app) to amend and expound if I feel so moved.
The idea that I need to write a complete topic sentence and full paragraph in that tiny area using a touch screen keyboard with my fat fingers is ludicrous. I want to leave a rating and maybe a few words and move on.

I wanted the whole thing hidden and being able to use the standard pumps ...
So after checking where the current double pumps are and where I could tie into - heres the design.
T inserted after rear top pump (pump is inside rear locker behind a carpeted panel - easy access) and bringing hose to the midship storage areas. T inserted in the vent lines coming out next to battery switch in the left (or trash bin in the right). Forgot vent valve at first so bags were draining but once empty the factory ballast wasnt as it was pulling in air ... should have seen this coming.
I used 1 1/8 tubing ... thought that Supra was using that too but that wasnt the case and as I bought all fittings for that size I just heated up the factory tubing so I could install my fittings. One thing I wanted to accomplish was that I can remove/disconnect everything if I needed to. So the T fittings are flow-rite connectors - so if I want to remove the whole thing I just use a connector to put 2 end hoses together and system is back to original.
Bought everything from flow-rite.com except the one way vent valves (wakemakers.com) and the bags (the-house.com or amazon). Flow rite is cheaper as they make the stuff and they ship really fast - got my stuff within 2 days each time. Why I didnt go with a larger ballast bag is simple - I wanted to have it all underneath without being pinched against hinges or rubbing on fiberglass. Im not using the entire depth of the storage compartment nor its length - however under each corner seat cushion I still have storage left. So the entire system is now filling and draining for the same amount of time as the front ballast before - just below 8 minutes or so. As said in the 2019 thread if I have 6 adults in the boat and they mostly sit in the back the system is passively draining but only from the added bags. Not sure if one of the impellers is shot but when trying to replace the lower ones I realized that I need to take out the floor panel above the gas tank as I dont have enough access to the lower pumps ... so 8 save that for another day. Cost overall is about 350 for all of it - will be cheaper if you just plump it in without the removable fittings obviously."

By Rebecca Rubin
LOS ANGELES ( Variety.com ) - In a twist ending straight out of a movie, ""The Equalizer 2"" shot past ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again' to steal the box office crown.
Going into the weekend, it looked like ""Mamma Mia! 2"" would easily debut at No. 1. Final numbers won't come in until Monday, but weekend estimates show Sony's ""The Equalizer"" sequel opened above estimates with $35.8 million when it launched in 3,388 locations, while Universal's highly anticipated follow-up to ""Mamma Mia!"" debuted with $34.4 million from 3,317 screens.
""Equalizer 2,"" the first sequel of Denzel Washington's nearly four-decade long career, launched ahead of its predecessor. 2014's ""The Equalizer"" opened with $35 million and went on to generate $192 million worldwide, including $101 million domestically.
Antoine Fuqua returned to direct ""The Equalizer 2,"" which also stars Pedro Pascal, Ashton Sanders, Melissa Leo, and Bill Pullman. Though it got a head start on the original film, reception has been less enthusiastic for the sequel, which currently holds a tepid 50 percent average on Rotten Tomatoes.
Though ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again"" couldn't dance its way to the top of the domestic box office, its $34 million opening is still a win. The original ""Mamma Mia!"" hit theatres a decade ago with $27 million. It became a box office hit, amassing $615 million worldwide on a $52 million budget. Much like the first film, the sequel will likely be a smash overseas, where Swedish pop group ABBA has a huge following.
Much of the star-studded cast -- including Amanda Seyfried, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard, Colin Firth, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, and Dominic Cooper -- returned for the second film. Lily James made her debut as a the younger version of Meryl Streep's charming and carefree Donna, while living legend Cher also joined the cast. Ol Parker, the screenwriter behind ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"" took over directing duties and penned the script.
The final wide release of the weekend, BH Tilt's ""Unfriended: Dark Web,"" got off to a scary start. The low-budget horror film debuted way below projections with $3.5 million from 1,546 locations. That might not matter, considering the Blumhouse title carries a $1 million price tag. ""Dark Web"" is a standalone sequel to 2015's ""Unfriended."" That film became a cash cow, opening with $15 million and going on to earn $64 million from a $41 million budget.
""The Grudge"" and ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" writer Stephen Susco made his directorial debut with ""Dark Web,"" which features Colin Woodell, Rebecca Rittenhouse, Betty Gabriel, and Andrew Lees.
Among holdovers, ""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" nabbed third place during its second outing. Sony's animated sequel picked up another $23 million from 4,267 locations, bringing its domestic tally to $91 million.
In fourth, Marvel's ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" pocketed $16 million from 3,778 screens in its third frame. In total, the Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily-led superhero blockbuster has made $165 million.
Disney-Pixar's ""Incredibles 2"" rounded out the top five with $11.3 million. In six weeks, the animated sequel has earned a massive $557 million in North America.
Meanwhile, Dwayne Johnson's ""Skyscraper"" continues to struggle in North America. Universal's action adventure dropped 56% in its sophomore weekend, collecting $11 million in 3,822 locations. The studio is hoping for massive returns internationally, where it opens this weekend in China.
At the speciality box office, Lionsgate's ""Blindspotting"" bowed with $332,500 when it opened in 14 theatres. That's a solid per-screen-average of $23,750. Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal co-wrote and star in ""Blindspotting, which debuted to raves at this year's Sundance Film Festival.
Bleecker Street's ""McQueen,"" a documentary chronicling the life of iconic fashion designer Alexander McQueen, landed the top theatre average of the weekend with $24,232. It scored $96,928 when it opened in four theatres.
Another new offering, Amazon Studios' ""Generation Wealth,"" bowed on four screens with $33,602 for a per-theatre-average of $8,401. More From Entertainment "

He cites Marilynne Robinson to explain the agita of our frantic life in the cloud, which accelerates our 'hypertrophic instinct for consensus.' We are hard-wired to be clannish, and our online habits exacerbate these penchants—for inclusion, for status, for affirmation—and strengthen their hold on us. Jacobs coins several terms to explain how this works. Whenever we hear something we disagree with we are tempted to enter 'Refutation Mode,' in which we stop listening because we have determined that 'no further information or reflection is required' on that subject. He draws our attention to what he calls the 'RCO,' short for 'Repugnant Cultural Other.' This phenomenon is so familiar to us as to be instinctive—Evangelical Christians are the RCO of secular academics and vice versa—and life online has enabled RCOs to shout at each other 'from two rooms away.' Other mental gymnastics include 'lumping' and 'splitting' people and ideas into “'Instant Taxonomies,' and 'in-other-wordsing' our RCO’s statements into reductive parodies that suit our purposes. Jacobs quotes psychologist Jonathan Haidt to argue that our tribes function as 'moral matrices' that 'bind people together and blind them to the coherence, or even existence, of other matrices.' Altogether, our instincts and our habits work to ensure that good thinking remains difficult.""
From ""To Think or Not to Think?"" by Mike St. Thomas in The American Interest (via A&L Daily ), reviewing ""How to Think: A Survival Guide for a World at Odds"" by Alan Jacobs.
St. Thomas is a little annoyed by all the terms Jacobs coins — does it help us think to have little nicknames for everything? — but I can see (at the Amazon link) that the book has gotten a lot of excellent reviews). "

While it's natural to feel a little envy over your favorite star's good looks, some fans have taken their celebrity admiration to the extreme by spending thousands of dollars to try and look just like them. Let's take a closer look at the mixed results of all that nipping, tucking, plumping, and more. Though Jennifer Lawrence has made a career out of being the girl-next-door type, she's also stunningly beautiful. According to ABC News, a woman named Kitty has spent at least $25,000 on six surgeries in order to look more like Lawrence. ""I can appreciate that her personality is spunky and fun. I can appreciate that her body is banging."" Kitty said that as Lawrence's popularity began to grow, more and more people began to compare her to the Oscar-winning actress. After the birth of her daughter, Kitty took her natural resemblance to the actress even further with the help of liposuction, breast implants, a nose job, and fat grafting. Keep up with Kim There's no doubt that Kim Kardashian is one of the most famous people on the planet, and plenty of women around the world are doing everything they can to emulate her curves, contoured cheeks, and plump pout. One of those women is Jennifer Pamplona, who reportedly spent more than $470,000 to keep up with this Kardashian. She told Australia's News.com in 2017, ""I fell in love with surgery a long time ago, but after seeing Kim Kardashian I wanted to look like and have curves like her."" Pamplona's surgeries reportedly included breast and butt implants, liposuction, a nose job, and the removal of a few ribs, but she's not done yet. While surgeons have told her it's not possible to continue with surgery, Pamplona claims she is, quote, ""determined to make it happen."" She went on to tell Life and Style Magazine, ""I will become more famous than Kim Kardashian."" It's not just women who are copying Kim. Jordan James Parke has reportedly spent upwards of $130,000 to make his face look more like the Kardashian. ""Botox in my forehead between my eyebrows, my eyes, sides of my face. I've had lip filler, chin filler, cheek filler, I've had my nose done."" Build yourself beautiful Kim isn't the only member of the Kardashian fam spawning costly lookalikes. Kyleigh Potts is a transgender woman who's reportedly spent more than $75,000 to look like Kim's half-sister Kylie Jenner. Potts told the Daily Mail that she's had lip fillers, breast implants, a chin implant, and a nose job. She confessed, ""I feel like I have always emulated [Kylie] and like her I didn't start out beautiful, I built myself beautiful."" Potts claimed she isn't finished with the surgical alterations, saying, ""I want to get butt implants, to pin and reshape my ears, a bullhorn lip lift, a [procedure] to help open up my eyes, lower my hairline, and voice change."" Man of plastic Herbert Chavez told VT that he became obsessed with Superman at age 5, and in an episode of Botched, he revealed that he was once the Guinness Book of World Records holder for ""most Superman memorabilia."" He's all grown up now and has reportedly undergone more than 20 surgeries, including rhinoplasties, pec implants, jaw work, and liposuction. But according to Chavez, life as a the Man of Steel isn't all it's cracked up to be. He told VT, ""It is hard living up to people's expectations as a living superhero."" Chavez said there's still one surgery he needs for his transformation to be complete: a leg lengthening procedure, which, according to the Paley Institute, costs up to $250,000. Being Barbie Even though Barbie's lead designer has said the doll's body is totally unrealistic, that didn't stop a Ukrainian woman named Valeria from attempting to achieve it. According to GQ, she only admits to having breast implants, though her striking figure and face have led many to believe there's more to her story. Valeria told InStyle that she will continue transforming, and that looking like Barbie isn't her final goal. ""I actually like very different images. My favorites are from the world of fantasy like elves, warriors, and Amazons."" Pursuit of perfection A 2017 This Morning interview revealed that Rodrigo Alves has spent more than $500,000 to look like a Ken doll. As of January 2018, however, it seems Alves' quest may be finished. ""So far it has been a want. If I have any more plastic surgery, it will be only if I need it, for medical reasons."" Of course, Alves has said this before. In 2016, the Daily Mail reported that Alves quit having work done following a health scare, though he later resumed his efforts with more surgery, including a rib removal. Only time will tell if Alves' transformation is truly complete.

Last week we did the second part of Jaina's story in which we talked about building up Orgrimmar, Theramore and the relations between the factions, trying to work towards peace and taking care of her beloved Arthas. So far Jaina has been a voice of peace on both sides, trying to make the factions come together. Her mindset was very similar to that of Anduin and they grew very fond of eachother, the prince seeing her as an aunt. Together they tried to keep Varian Wrynn under control as the king's history with the Horde has seen nothing but pain and suffering, the murder of his father, the fall of stormwind, enslaved as a gladiator... Varian's time has been rough and being split and reformed by Onyxia has left him unbalanced. Rage often boiled at the surface, striking out not only the battlefield where it suited him, but also towards those he loved. A good example of this is just before the cataclysm happened, the war against the lich king was over and the Alliance and Horde had agreed to end hostilities towards eachother. There was a ceremony in Stormwing to honor the thousands who had died in the war, but night elf sentinels showed up with dire news. The Horde had attacked Ashenvale and the treaty had been broken. It wasn't a mere act of aggression from the past, expected bumps in the road for the treaty, it was a slaughter. They had been unable to recover the bodies because they had been methodically chopped into several pieces. And those pieces were taken away by carrion eaters. This was after they had been skinned and they were not sure if they were alive for that or not. The skins were hung like linens from a nearby tree. And on that tree, written in elven blood, were Horde Symbols... Varian quickly called for Thrall's head. The orcs had done this, the Horde had to pay but Jaina threw back at him that they didn't know if it was the Horde. She fought and bled with Thrall, could not believe he would order this. Is Varian responsible for all humans, like the defias brotherhood that took his wife's life? This pissed of Varian, Lo'Gosh came out to play dirty and he asked her what if he's right and she's wrong? She had been a poor judge of character in the past. Now he was throwing Arthas at her, but none of them could have predicted what he would become. This may be, but Varian wasn't making the same mistake twice and she was. If she had seen what Arthas would become, would she have tried to stop him? Would she have the guts to kill her lover, or would she have stood by, peace at all costs, a mewling little pacifist who – Father!' The word was uttered by Anduin, shock and bitter disappointment in his father clear on his face. Like I said, Varian's rage hurt those around him and while he would work on trying to find balance, harness that rage inside, Jaina continued negotiations and trying to work both sides towards a brighter future. Yet with the world in turmoil, one of her best allies in this quest, warchief thrall, decided the time had come to return to his ancestral lands to figure out what was going on. He decided to leave Garrosh Hellscream behind as warchief of the Horde, despite several voices telling him that this was a bad idea, including Garrosh himself, he had made up his mind and left the son of Grommash in charge. You might remember Garrosh being quite against the idea of working together with the alliance and taking on the mantle of leadership only encouraged him to indulge his warlike ways. He believed the horde was being too timid. The war had depleted their resources, the elemental turmoil only made things worse. After thrall had departed, garrosh turned his gaze northwest to the lush forest of ashenvale. It was a land of plenty and it was well within the horde's reach. Most of the region belonged to the night elves but that did not stop garrosh from sending troops into the woodlands. He was not interested in asking the alliance for resources or trading for them. Why would he do that, when he could simply take what he wanted by force. The horde's new incursion into ashenvale enraged the alliance. Tensions between the factions flared and open war seemed inevitable. Some of the horde's members welcomed these bolds and aggresive maneuvers, but cairne bloodhoof, leader of the tauren did not. He dideverything he could to reason with the acting warchief and prevent bloodshed. In carine's eyes, garrosh was leading the horde down a a dangerous path, one that would inevitable destroy it. The warchief did not listen to his wisdom, and so cairne spoke the only language the orc would understand. He challenged garrosh to a mak'gora, a ritiaulistic duel. Before a crowd of onlookers, the tauren and the orc fought for the future of the horde itself. On one side stood the promise of a peaceful future. On the other, the promise of blood and conquest. ""Garrosh, you are not fit to rule the horde."" It was because of Magatha Grimtotem that blood and conquest won that day. She had dreamed of seizing her race's capital, thunder bluff, and asserting control over all tauren. Only cairne had stood in her way so she had secrely, without his knowledge coated garrosh's weapon gorehowl with poison. So it was that the tauren who had lived his life with honor died betrayed. After the duel, magatha led a coup in thunder bluff and seized the city. Yet her victory was short lived. Cairne's son, Baine bloodhoof was warned of the attack and made his escape. He didn't exactly know who he could trust at that point. Was Garrosh perhaps in on the betrayel? So instead they turned to the one their former warchief had trusted, Lady Jaina at Theramore. It was around this time that Magni Bronzebeard used an ancient titan ritual to also figure out what was going on with the land and turned himself into a crystal. His daughter Moira made use of this oppertunity to take over and lock down Ironforge, including Anduin who was there visiting. Luckily Jaina had given him a hearthstone which he used to teleport out of there right into a meeting between Baine and Jaina. These three characters had a very similar mindset towards the world, got a long quite nicely and Jaina decided to financially aid Baine in retaking the city. Magatha was foolishly hoping for Garrosh to support her cou, but the warchief could not appreciate the dishonor she had bestowed upon him. He would never know who would have won in a fair fight so he left her on her own and Baine decided to banish her and the grimtotem that stayed at her side. Meanwhile Thrall learned more about his shamanistic roots and Deathwing broke out starting the expansion of the cataclysm. Jaina didn't play a massive role in fighting Deathwing, besides showing up at Thrall's wedding, but with a new warchief in charge, a world in turmoil and resources scarce, the war between the alliance and the horde started to pick up again. With Garrosh's wish of defeating the night elves and conquering the whole of Kalimdor, the humans of theramore sent out their armies and tried to establish a military line between the night elf territory and Theramore. They didn't exactly get the result they expected with events like Stonetalon mountains, the Barrens and Camp Taurajo but the dream of peace seemed further away then ever. Varian completed his journey of becoming whole while accepting the Worgen into the Alliance and defeating Garrosh in Ashenvale, earning himself the title of high king of the alliance. They were unified like never before. Thrall, now going by the name Go'ell united with the dragon aspects and together they were able to save the world, defeat Deathwing and prevent the hour of twilight. ""Today's victory belongs to all who stood against the shadow. You are azeroths true guardians and the future of this world is in your hands. For the dawning of the age of mortals has begun. "" And what do the mortals do? Start an even bigger war of course as Garrosh focuses his gaze on Theramore. If they want to secure Kalimdor then they have to wipe out this human port so the Horde forces are gathered and get ready for their march. Jaina meets up with Go'el to see if there isn't anything they can do to stop this. His duties to the world were done, he had set out and accomplished the near impossible, but go'el was now leader of the earthen ring and the world still needed their aid to heal. Despite what Garrosh had done like Cairne and Ashenvale, the alliance had not been perfect either. That had been innocents, but even Jaian cannot place the blame for the current tensions squarely at Garrosh's feet. Not all the attacks had been initiated by the Horde and she knew the truth of his words. There were times when she felt that her words just fall on deaf ears. The only one who seems to be truly interested in forging a lasting peace is Anduin wrynn and he's just fourteen. It's difficult to try to be a diplomat and work for real, solid results when the other side won't acknowledge reason anymore... ""I'm sorry what? Thrall and me? Who keeps spreading that nasty rumor. Besides, everyone knows I prefer blue over green."" Go'el stays on leading the earthen ring while Jaina returns home where she's visisted by the blue dragon Kalecgos. His flight has lost the focusing iris, a powerful magical item previously held within the nexus and he's looking for help to try and track it down. Jaina turns out to not only be a great help with this, the 2 of them also develop feelings for eachother. But times of romance would have to be put on hold as Garrosh lead the Horde towards Theramore with Northwatch hold as their first goal to claim. Despite some of the leaders not being too happy about settings sights on theramore. They believed that this would just piss off the rest of the alliance and cause more trouble then it was worth, they still stuck to their honor and followed their warchiefs lead if not for the sake of their people. Northwatch was a tough battle, but Garrosh had some tricks up his sleeve. He had his shamans summon molten giants to make quick work of the enemy which Baine couldn't exactly appreciate. The world was still healing from the cataclysm, this was an afront to the earthmother! What was Garrosh thinking? Not only that, he was also struggling with the upcoming battle as he remembered how Jaina had been there for him when he needed aid the most. He decided that although he would not shrug away from his duties to the horde, he would not let jaina be caught unawares. Perhaps he could save some innocent lives by sending her a messenger, a warning that the Horde was on the move. Some might call this an act of treason, but I can't imagine Garrosh being too mad about it as it worked quite well for his plans. He actually held his troops back giving Jaina the time to gather allies for the defense of theramore. The alliance, the Kirin tor including their leader Rhonin and even the blue dragon kalecgos all offered their aid to lady Jaina Proudmoore. When Garrosh did finally send his troops out they stood shoulder to shoulder trying to hold the line. The Horde breached their gates because of a traitor from within, Thalen Songweaver recommended by Rhonin himself to join them, actively worked against them and the gates splintered. The traitor was taken captive and would later be saved by members of the horde, but the battle at theramore wasn't over quite yet. Kalec dropped trees and boulders from the sky to block the entrances, trying to trap the Horde within. They had no choice but to call the retreat, Jaina couldn't believed it, they had won...they had actually won the day... ""Hehe we're going to turn this place into a sinkhole."" As it turns out, it was the Horde who had taken the focusin iris and turned it into a bomb. They could see it coming of course, but their flyers had been neutralized and Kalec was blown out of the sky with canon fire. Rhonin could see it coming and decided to make the ultimate sacrifice by drawing the bomb onto himself and into their protective magics. It would not hold the explosion, it would not save everyone, but it was the best that he could do. Jaina tried to protest, tried to argue, tried to find a way for him not to kill himself. She would not abandon him, maybe together they could divert it but it was too late. The sky galleon released its cargo. She would never remember exactly what happened next. She felt herself being both pushed and pulled toward the still-whirling portal entrance, a portal held by Rhonin. She shouted in protest, trying to tug herself free and craned her neck to look back just in time to see hell. The world went absolutely white. The towered shattered. Rhonin's body, standing tall, arms oustrechted as he glared defiantly as his fate, turned suddenly purple. He was frozen in time for a fraction of a heartbeat; then the exploded in a cloud of lavender ash. As the portal whirled closed and Jaina was dragged farher and farther away, she saw a violet ocean of arcane energy wash over Theramore. Cries of utter, absolute, depthless terror assaulted her ears, and then she knew no more... Rhonin's heroic sacrifice saved the life of his beloved wife Vereesa Windrunner as well as Shandris Feathermoon, Kalecgos and Jaina. But many were caught in the explosion. Rhonin himself of course, Archmage Tervosh. Tiras'alan who traveled all the way from Outland as word of Jaina's great deeds and efforts for peace had even reached Shattrath City. Admiral Tarlen Aubrey and Tari Cogg. General Marcus Jonathan, for many years a stalward guardian at the stormwind gates. Amara Leeson and Thoder Windermere. Pained, a bodyguard assigned to Jaina by Tyrande as they fought at the battle of mount hyjal. Thaddus Stoutblow, Horran Redmane and Kinndy Sparkshine, Jaina's new and young apprentice. When Baine looked upon the explosion, tears ran down his muzzle, and he made no effort to wipe them away. He stood surrounded by throngs of cheering Horde, but as he looked around, he saw, illuminated by the ghostly arcane glow, faces that wore his own expression of shock and revulsion. Did none of them see? Baine couldn't understand it. So many, too many, seemed happy at beholding the dead city and crowded with corpses of people who had died in a horribly and painful fashion. They were happy at being tricked into a battle against theramore when all along garrosh had had the means to win without sacrifing a single horde life. Baine was not sure which act he despised more. Jaina was saved by Rhonin, but the diplomat, the peaceseeker was gone. The transformation was visible for all to see as the explosion of the bomb had turned her hair white with a single blonde streek of the past. Her eyes too were glowing white but on the inside the pain was unbearable. When she returned to theramore to look for any survivors, she saw the corpses of those who had fought with her eerily floating in the air. Not even the rats had survived the attack and her new apprentice, Kinndy Sparkshine, crumbled into violet dust at her touch. Jaina screamed. She screamed in utter horrror, frantically gathering up the crstalline poweder that was all that remained of a smart, lively, young woman. She screamed in loss, in grief, in guilt, and then most of all in rage. Rage at the Horde. Rage at Garrosh Hellscream, rage at those who followed him. Rage at Baine Bloodhoof, who had warned her but had nonetheless permitted this to happen. Had perhaps known this was going to happen. Her screaming turned to racking, hoarse sobs that ripped her throat. She kepft lifting handfuls of the purple sand, trying to hold on to Kinndy, her sobbing increasing as the dust persisted in trickling through her fingers. This wasn't war. This wasn't even murder. This was obliteration done at a comfortable distance. Killing in the most brutal and cowardly fashion Jaina could conceive of. She did not find any survivors, but she did encounter a group of orcs poking around the debris, laughing too eachother, looting of the dead. ""No one can protect you! Kill the proudmoore wench and bring me that bomb! Your people are dispicable cowards, orcs. Youre nothing more then rabbit dogs and you will be put down. Brave words mage, I will spit in your face when you beg for mercy."" ""YOu spit on mercy? Then you will have none! You want carnage? Garrosh will have more blood then he ever bargained for."" ""ROar ill bring the warchief your head!"" She recovered the focusing iris and set out to gain allies in her quest for vengeance, but found rejection on all sides. Funny enough where in the past she had to hold Varian back, now the roles were reversed. The king had found balanace, make no mistake they would make the Horde pay but on their terms. They could not rush in, they had to be smarter then that, rebuild, gather their forces. With the focusin iris she believed they could destroy Orgrimmar just as surely as they had destroyed Theramore but they needed to act now, when their armies are foolishly gathered together in Orgrimmar. Anduin tried to reason, surely not everyone amongst the Horde agreed with what happened. The tauren for instance and even most orcs prize honor, but for Jaina it was far too late for that. There's no hope for peace; there's no time for stragey. She has their ruination in her graps and they're a fool for not seizing the chance. She turned her back on them both as they tried to calm her down, tried to make her listen, but she would not. Her next stop lead her to Dalaran where she asked the aid of the Kirin Tor. Vereesa Windrunner had returned to Dalaran after the battle and she was as wounded as Jaina was, even more perhaps with now being a widow and having to raise their twins by herself. Jaina told her about the final moments with Rhoninm that all he cared about were two things when he died. he wanted to make sure his beloved would survive and that Jaina would survive. He bought their lives with his own, and Jaina doesn't understand why he saved her. Theramore was her city; she should have died for it. But he was the one who died. And she will not forget that, not as long as she draws breath. She will ure the council to make sure the Horde is never, ever in so powerful a position again. That no one else has to suffer as they have. Vereesa's lips curved into a trembling smile, and the next thig the mage knew, the two women were hugging each other tightly, and Jaina felt warm tears against her neck. While she waited on their ruling, she also visited the sparkshine family. She had planned to be eloquent, to praise Kinndy as the girl deserved. To give her bereaved family comfort, to let them know that Kinndy had fought well and bravely, that she had been a light to everyone who knew her. That she died defending others. What burst from Jaina's lips was 'I'm sorry, I'm so....so sorry.""And for several long moments it was the sparkshines who gave Jaina Proudmoore comfort. Windle lights the streetlights in the city and with special permission, he lights them in honor of his daughter. The golden light was tracing the shape of a laughing gnome girl with pigtails. When the sketch was done, it came to life for a moment, small hands covering a giggling mouths, and Jaina could have sworn she heard Kinndy's voice. She glanced down with blurred vision at Windle and saw the gnome, too, wept, though his eyes crinkled a loving smile... Despite her wishes, Khadgar lets her know that the Kirin Tor will not join her in this slaughter. There are innocents in orgrimmar, people who never marched on theramore, an orphenage even...but Jaina sees no innocents, only those that are being taught to hate them and will one day march for the Horde. Before Khadgar could speak, she had already conjured a portal to the library of dalaran, stealing a book with information on the focusing iris, if nobody was going to help her, then she was going to do it herself. Before finally leaving the city she made a quick trip to the statue of Antonidas and there she ran into Kalecgos again who was still busy looking for the iris. He too was asked to join her, to help her destroy the horde, but he can't ... This hatred it wasn't her. The jaina he knew still sought peace, still tried to understand even as she prepared to defend her people. He can't believe she truly wants to perpetrate the same horror on them as they did to theramore. This is me...this is who the horde made when they dropped that cursed bomb on my city. You don't want to help me? You don't hear the voices that cry out for justice? FIne. Don't help me, but whatever you do, do not get in my way... Voices from all sides told her to stop and think, to not go through with this, but Jaina refused to listen. She spend days working her magic gathering elemental forces of water to create a massive tidal wave and flood all of orgrimmar. The men, women and children all would feel the pain she had felt, but the elements did not want to do this, screamed out in protest. Their cries of anguish were heard by Go'el and he found his old friend about to make a huge mistake. It took everything he had just to hold the tidalwave in place. Jaina was wounded, anguished, placed the blame of Theramore squarly at Thrall's feet. He left garrosh in charge of the horde. She had begged him to come back, to remove him from power. She knew he would do something terrible one day and he has. Garrosh may have done this – but she blames him for giving him the power to do so. The words shocked the earth shaman and their battle was intense. Nothing he said reached her, all he could do was focus on that tidal wave and while he was not ready to take Jaina's life, she felt no such reservations. Thankfully, Kalecgos showed up in search of the focusing Iris and he found it together with its dark mistress. He understood her loss and knew that what she felt, but regardless if she claimed her vengeance or not, the people she had lost would not come back. Jaina's hurting and the Horde must pay. Thrall agreed, the Horde had to pay but not by her hand, not this way. There is justice and there is vengeance. She must see the difference between the two or else she'd betrayed those who loved her. Garrosh is a thief and a coward and a butcher but she was doing precisely what he had – right down to using the same artifact that had obliterated theramore. Is this what she wanted? To be remmebered as a garrosh by her own people? I am doing what I know to be right, she shouted as did Arthas, Kalec responded when he slaughtered everyone in Stratholme. And he at least didn't act with hate in his heart toward those he killed. Is this what her lagacy was going to be, to be another garrosh another arthas? ""Jaina...? I'm sorry Arthas, I can watch you do this."" No...she decided...she would not. For what he has done, Garrosh can be nothing but her enemy and the Horde as well, as long as he is their warchief. She would not use the elementals gathered to flood all of orgrimmar, instead she would use it to defend her people. Go'el went back to the earthen ring, the former friends knowing that this good bye meant the end of their friendship for so many years, so cherished and championed by both. It would be a long, long time, if ever – before Jaina could call Trall friend again. And she knew he knew it. Kalec stayed at Jaina's side and offered to carry her where ever she wished. She wanted to see orgrimmar with her own eyes and on route they discovered that Varian and the Alliance fleet had also made their way here. Despite their clever planning, Garrosh had his own tricks to use against them. He had his shaman raise kraken from the deep, kraken with huge tentacles that whipped about vessels, closing around it in a parody of a loving embrace. The warchief did not just send the creatures of the deep to do his fighting, he too, gorehowl in hand, jumped into the fight. Varian saw that despite the Horde fleet being vastly outnumbers, Garrosh's tactics of using the kraken was doing insane amounts of damage. They would have probably lost the whole fleet was it not for Jaina and Kalecgos, sending her water elementals to save the fleet. She had not expected them to be here, she thought that they would focus on breaking the blockade at Darkshore or Feathermoon Stronghold. If she had truly send out her tidal wave...she would have destroyed both Orgrimmar and the whole Alliance fleet. Luckily that didn't happen and Jaina was able to turn the tide of battle. She and the alliance were able to defeat the Horde and reclaim Northwatch hold. Together with Kalec she visited Theramore once more, not to rage and hate but to observe and mourn. The love between the blue and the mage was still growing and she wondered where to go next, what she wanted in this world. She still cared for peace, but she's no longer who she was. She doesn't burn for vengeance, but neither is she the woman who longed so much for harmony between the Horde and the Alliance. There can't be harmony, not while Garrosh leads the Horde, not after what he has done. She doesn't believe peace is the answer anymore which means...she doesn't know where she belongs. Kalec thinks she does, she wanted to go home...Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. She offered her services to them, but they did not just want her as a member, they actually wanted her to become their leader. The reason why Rhonin had saved her instead of himself was because of a prophecy made by the red dragon korialstraz. After the red comes the silvers, She who was golden and bright; The proud lady humbled and bitter Shall now turn her thoughts to the fight. Sapphire to diamond she gleams now, The Kirin Tor leader who comes, 'QUeen' of a kingdom now fallen, Marching to war's martial drums. Be ye warned – the tides of war At last shall break upon the shore. But to just choose her based on this, she couldn't imagine yet Aethas explained that it wasn't just because of this prophecy. She had always been strong in power and character. Even when tested and tried. And when she faced both an unimaginable horrror and an inconceivable temptation – and were perhaps tainted by the effects of the mana bomb – she still chose a path that was fair and just, rathen then vengeful and dark. Yet she did not do this alone, she had help from Kalec to show her the right path so the blue also decided to join the kirin tor. And so it was that Lady Jaina Proudmoore became the leader of the kirin tor, knowing full well that the world could not be safe with garrosh hellscream as the leader of the Horde. The warchief had lost the battle, but was far from defeated. Garrosh believed that they were simply thinking too small. Next time they would have to go bigger, more elements, more kraken, more of everything. Yet there are voices amongst the Horde that do not believe his actions, his way of warfare are the way to go. Baine wondered if Garrosh was mad with power or simply mad. The friction between the alliance and the Horde and within the Horde itself would make its way to a land previously covered by strange mists, but that's a story we'll save for next week as then we'll finish up the story of Jaina Proudmoore.

“The idea for The Yoga Book came to me in a yoga class! I saw it clearly in my mind and I needed somewhere to write it down. Also, I had recently met with an Indian medical doctor, who had said “Di fferent styles of yoga effect people differently, so i t is important to know which ‘style of yoga’ is right for you.” So, I decided to create a book, where people could journal about their experiences in a yoga class, write about the different postures – how they felt, get inspired, and write about their insights… Sometimes I would come to class with a problem, any problem, and leave with a solution! And when I did, I’d write it down somewhere, so I decided to create The Yoga Book.”

US health officials are warning people to avoid certain foods due to ongoing unrelated outbreaks of intestinal infections caused by bacteria, viruses and even parasites lurking in some of our food.
Here’s what to stay away from: Pasta salad
Hy-Vee, a Midwestern grocery store chain, has recalled a pasta salad that might be linked to at least 20 people getting sick from salmonella. Hy-Vee, based in Iowa, sold the 1-pound and 3-pound plastic containers of Spring Pasta Salad in eight states.
The states are Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota — where the salmonella illnesses were reported — and Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Wisconsin.
The product was produced between June 1 and July 13. The packages have expiration dates between June 22 and August 3.
Symptoms of salmonella begin 12 to 72 hours after a person is infected and include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramping. This can last about four to seven days, and most individuals recover without treatment. However, those who develop severe diarrhea may need to be hospitalized. Those who are very young, who are very old or who have compromised immune systems are most at risk for complications and severe cases of illness. Raw turkey
Salmonella is the culprit in 90 illnesses linked to raw turkey products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Agriculture.
The illnesses have been reported in 26 states since November. But health officials have not identified a brand, product or supplier as the source of the outbreak.
Patients who have been interviewed reported eating “different types and brands of turkey products purchased from many different locations. Two ill people lived in a household where raw turkey pet food was fed to pets,” the CDC said.
In addition, samples of raw turkey pet food, raw turkey products and live turkeys have tested positive for the outbreak strain of salmonella, which could mean the outbreak is “widespread in the turkey industry,” the CDC said. Cut melon
Put down the fork and step away from cut melon or fruit salad mixes that contain it.
The US Food and Drug Administration is warning people in 23 states that the fruit may be contaminated with salmonella.
The outbreak has affected 60 people mostly in five Midwestern states, with about half of them hospitalized.
Cut watermelon, honeydew and cantaloupe as well as fruit salads containing these melons have been recalled in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
The fruits were sold in stores such as Walmart, Kroger, Walgreens, Sprouts Farmers Market, Costco and Whole Foods/Amazon. Kellogg’s Honey Smacks cereal
Federal health officials want you to toss out all boxes of Kellogg’s Honey Smacks. The warning is due to an outbreak of salmonella that has left 100 people sick in 33 states .
The cereal was recalled June 14, but one month later, another warning not to eat the cereal was issued after the FDA said it was aware that it was still available.
“Retailers cannot legally offer the cereal for sale and consumers should not purchase Kellogg’s Honey Smacks cereal,” the agency said. Swiss rolls
Flowers Foods announced a recall of Swiss rolls because they may be contaminated with salmonella. The ingredient whey powder was recalled for possible contamination. There have been no reports of illness from Swiss rolls, according to the company.
Swiss rolls sold nationwide under the brand names Mrs. Freshley’s, Food Lion, H-E-B, Baker’s Treat, Market Square, and Great Value have been recalled. Captain John Derst’s Old Fashioned Bread distributed in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina have also been recalled, the company said. Ritz Cracker Sandwiches
Mondelēz Global LLC announced a voluntary recall of certain Ritz Cracker Sandwiches and other Ritz Bits products because they contain whey powder that has been recalled for possible salmonella contamination. The products are available nationwide.
The voluntary recall is a precaution, as no complaints of illness have been reported, the company said.
The recalled product list includes Ritz Bits cheese cracker sandwiches and mixed cookie and cracker variety packs. McDonald’s salads
As a precaution, McDonald’s has stopped selling salads in 3,000 locations in 14 states to try to contain an outbreak of cyclospora illness.
The states no longer selling these salads are Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Kentucky, West Virginia and Missouri.
To date, 163 cases have been confirmed in 10 states since May 1, according to the CDC .
The cyclospora parasite causes intestinal illness as a result of consuming contaminated food or water. Symptoms can begin a week or more after consuming the parasite. They include diarrhea and frequent, sometimes explosive bowel movements, according to the CDC. Those who are infected might also experience loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps or pain, nausea, gas and fatigue. Vomiting, headache, fever, body aches and flu-like symptoms can also occur.
The illness can last from a few days to a few months, and patients might feel better but then get worse again. Patients can be treated with antibiotics. Vegetable trays
Before you grab something off that vegetable tray, make sure it hasn’t been recalled.
The FDA is investigating at least 237 cases of cyclospora illnesses linked to recalled Del Monte Fresh vegetable trays . The trays contained broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and dill dip, and they were sold in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana.
“FDA has not identified which of the ingredients is the vehicle for this outbreak; each component of these vegetable trays is under consideration,” the agency said.
Cyclospora cayetanensis is a microscopic parasite that contaminates food or water and, when ingested, causes an intestinal illness. Symptoms include diarrhea, with sometimes explosive bowel movements, loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps, bloating, nausea and fatigue. Imported crab meat
Avoid eating fresh crab meat from Venezuela. That’s the advice from the FDA due to an outbreak of Vibrio parahaemolyticus that started in April. In all, 12 illnesses have been reported in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Louisiana and the District of Columbia.
“This product is commonly found in plastic tubs and may be labeled as ‘pre-cooked,’” the FDA said in its outbreak announcement .
Symptoms usually begin 24 hours after consuming the bacteria. They include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, fever and abdominal pain. Twelve people have become sick.

I agree the popcorn is REALLY good, but I just could not bring myself to mix them. I separated them on a napkin like one of my kids would.
I LOVE this popcorn! I used to buy the Chicago Mix popcorn at Sam’s Club, but prefer the Wickedly Prime version!

Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, is urging President Trump to safeguard the U.S. election process ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, telling the president to ""lead this nation to make sure the 2018 election is protected.""
Graham, a frequent Trump ally, said that the president often gets the issue of Russian interference ""confused"" with the accusations of of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
""You didn't collude with the Russians, or at least I haven't seen any evidence, but Mr. President, they meddled in the elections. They stole [John] Podesta's emails, they hacked into the DNC, it could be us next. It could be some other power, not just Russia. Harden our electoral infrastructure for 2018,'"" Graham said on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday.
Transcript: Sen. Lindsey Graham on ""Face the Nation,"" July 22, 2018
Graham, citing the president's top intelligence chief Dan Coats, said that the ""red light is blinking"" and that he needs to ""sit down with Congress and the administration and you lead this nation to hardening the 2018 election process before it's too late.""
© CBS News graham2.jpg Regarding the mixed messages stemming from the meeting between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Finland last week, Graham said that he's glad Mr. Trump is ""willing to walk things back and say he misspoke if it makes us stronger,"" adding that Mr. Trump has shown he's ""willing to change"" his views.
He noted, however, that what the president needs to do ""is lead this nation to make sure the 2018 election is protected and he needs to be the leader of the movement, not brought to the dance reluctantly.""
While the White House has said Mr. Trump could sit down with Putin once again this fall, Graham cautioned the president, saying that there needs to be a new set of strict sanctions imposed on Russia before any meeting.
""If he does show up, you need to have new sanctions over Putin's head,"" said Graham, urging a set of sanctions that ""would be a hammer over Russia's head"" for interfering in the U.S. electoral process.
""Do not meet with this guy from a position of weakness,"" he added. ""You need to be the leader of that movement and you need to work with Congress to come up with new sanctions because Putin's not getting the message. you've been tougher than Obama. I'll give you credit for that Mr. President, but it's not working. If you were really tough with Putin he would not be doing what he's doing."""

EXCLUSIVE
Justin Timberlake is jumping on the Amazon Prime Day bandwagon and offering up a deal … slashing the price of his SoHo penthouse Monday by nearly a quarter million.
Justin’s now asking $6.75 million for the 3 bedroom, 3.5 bath crib. He put it on the market about 5 months ago for $7.995 mil, but dropped the price by a mil in the spring before knocking off an additional $245k this week.
JT purchased the ultra modern 2,600 sq. ft. place for $6.57 million back in 2010. Its neatest feature is probably the wraparound terrace, which is 853 square feet alone. The building also has a gym, garden and parking garage with a private entrance.
Jared Seligman from Stribling holds the listing. 関連"

There are a couple of things you can check. First, do you have an Amazon Freetime profile set up? If not, click here for the steps to create one.
Once the Freetime profile is setup, or if it is already in place, the next thing to check is Parental Controls. Swipe down from the top of the screen, and select Settings (gear icon). Then choose Parental Controls. From here, you have many options to choose from. In your case, I would start by blocking Amazon Stores , which will restrict access to your order history. And then by going to Amazon Content and Apps , scrolling down to Photos , you can block your cloud photos from your grandson's tablet.
I really hope this helps! Let us know if you have more questions, and welcome to the forum"

It's one of the most common questions financial advisers hear: should I prioritize paying down debt or building up savings?
Americans have a cozy relationship with debt — student loans, credit cards and car loans are commonplace. The Federal Reserve said that consumer borrowing rose $24.5 billion in May alone to hit almost $3.9 trillion. And that doesn't include mortgage or real estate-secured debt, like home equity lines. Add rising interest rates to that mix and you've got quite the budget burden.
Debt can help advance your life, for example by paying for an education to get a job or buying a car to get to work. But paying it back also uses up money that could be set aside for emergencies, retirement or other expenses. Research shows most Americans are ill-prepared to face a minor financial hiccup, let alone the cost of retirement.
So how do you meet these competing demands? We talked to a few financial experts for their tips.
ASSESS
First, take a good look at what you're up against. How much debt do you have and at what interest rates? How much savings do you have? Other questions to consider, according to SoFi certified financial planner Alison Norris, include: are you only making minimum payments? Are your finances a source of stress in your life?
Then look at your budget - knowing how much money you have to work with will help you figure out what is feasible moving forward, said Charlie Bolognino, a certified financial planner in Bentonville, Arkansas. The budget is the key to unlocking solutions.
""We hear we are supposed to do all these things with money — save it, spend it, invest it and get out of debt — but there's only so much money to go around,"" said Bolognino.
PLAN
Come up with a strategy you can stick with.
A successful plan will address both debt and savings in concert, to make the most of the money you do have. It's not about focusing on one issue then moving on to the next, but rather a matter of determining where your spending priority is, said Bruce McClary of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.
A rule of thumb is to allocate 20 percent of your take-home pay to savings and debt payments. How you divvy that up will depend on your priorities.
One thing the experts agree on: make emergency savings a top priority. Don't worry about getting several months of savings set aside. Even $500 can provide peace of mind. This allows you to handle life's unexpected emergencies, like a car repair or lost cell phone, without further running up debt.
Tackling your highest interest rate debt needs to be near the top too. The average interest rate on credit cards is around 17 percent and more interest rate hikes are anticipated in the near future, according to McClary. Compare that to the single-digit interest rate you might get from a standard savings account and it's an easy decision.
""It's the best time ever to not carry a balance,"" he said.
Calculate how long it will take to pay off your debt — knowing that date will remind you there's light at the end of the tunnel.
Then think about your lower-interest rate debt like federal student loans. While it may be tempting to turn your back on longer-term savings, don't - that is just trading today's financial ruin for another down the road. Don't overlook opportunities for workplace retirement savings accounts, particularly if your employer matches your contribution. Failing to give at least the amount up to that level is like leaving money on the table, said Paul Golden of the National Endowment for Financial Education.
Some employers may have additional benefits to help with saving or paying down student loans. Pharmaceutical company Abbott Laboratories recently rolled out a unique program that makes a 5 percent company contribution to the 401(k) of employees who contribute 2 percent of their pay toward their student loans. That helps them reach both financial goals of retirement savings and student loan repayment.
If you find you simply cannot make minimum payments on your debts or have exhausted your financial options, reach out for help through a nonprofit credit counseling organization.
""There's a point when you can't go it alone anymore,"" McClary said."

Earth or Planet Earth is a planet that features a wide variety of people, cultures, and ecosystems. While the Earth that appears in Super Mario has some features derived from the nonfictional entity, fictional alterations to the planet have been applied in the series. The planet has been referred to as the "" Real World "" by citizens of the Mushroom Kingdom in the cartoons . However, this is no longer addressed in recent material, meaning that the real ""Earth"" and the Mario version of Earth are now instead considered as being the one and the same.
Planet Earth is featured as the setting of the Mario & Sonic series, in which species from the Mario games are also present on Earth. It also is the setting of Mario is Missing! , in which Luigi must travel around the globe on a hunt to rescue Mario and save the world. Contents Lands of Earth [ edit ] Original map of the real world.
Earth is organized into seven continents whose borders are based on geographical features rather than political boundaries. Continents are not necessarily separated by water. With the exception of Antarctica , each continent is further subdivided into countries, political bodies ruled by a government. Several countries are in more than one continent. The subdivisions of countries vary, but every country has population centers such as towns or cities. Africa [ edit ]
Africa is home to both sandy deserts and lush rain forests. Its nations include but are not limited to Egypt , Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and Ethiopia. Humans and a variety of exotic animal species inhabit this continent. In the The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 episode 7 Continents for 7 Koopas , Kooky goes to Africa, where he turns all the animals there into stuffed animals. Antarctica [ edit ]
Antarctica is a large icy, ferociously cold desert continent located at the southernmost point of the planet, mostly populated by penguins . It is the only continent that does not have specific countries ruling portions of it; however, it has territories that are owned by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom. There are also some islands along the Antarctic plate that are associated with the continent of Antarctica; these are claimed by Australia, Norway, France and South Africa. In 7 Continents for 7 Koopas , Big Mouth is sent to Antarctica, where he builds an Abominable Snowkoopa that goes around scaring penguins. In Mario is Missing! , Bowser attempts to melt Antarctica in a plot to flood Earth. Asia [ edit ]
The largest continent, Asia is home to a variety of countries, including Japan , China and India. The Great Wall of China is one of the continent's most famous landmarks. In 7 Continents for 7 Koopas , Bully is sent here and does graffiti on it. China's nation capital, Beijing , was the location of the Olympic Games in which Mario , Sonic the Hedgehog , and others competed during the events of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games . Oceania [ edit ]
The smallest continent on Earth and its largest country is Australia , which is home to a variety of animal species, including Kangaroos . Alligator Dundee originally lived on this continent. It is often referred to as ""down under"" due to its location in the southern half of the planet. In 7 Continents for 7 Koopas , Cheatsy is sent here and he turns almost all the humans into kangaroos, except one of them, of whom he turns into a shrimp, where all the crocodiles (which are standing up) go ahead and chase him to eat him up. Europe [ edit ]
Europe shares a land mass with Asia, separated from it by the Ural Mountains. Famous for its varied culture and large role in Earth's history, Europe is divided into countries such as France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Italy. Famous cities include Paris and Venice . In 7 Continents for 7 Koopas , Kootie Pie is sent to the Louvre in France, where she turns famous paintings into paintings of her (Mona Kootie Pie, etc). England's capital city, London, was the main setting for Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games , where the 2012 Summer Olympics took place. In addition, the Russian city of Sochi was the main setting for Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games , where the 2014 Winter Olympics took place. North America [ edit ]
North America is the location of the United States of America , Canada, and Mexico, among some other nations. The United States of America is home to many famous and influential cities and other locations, many of which were featured in The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! and The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 . These include Brooklyn , which is sometimes depicted as the place where Mario and Luigi used to live, Washington, D.C. , the nation's capital, Hawaii and the Kennedy Space Center . The Canadian city of Vancouver is the location of the game Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games . In 7 Continents for 7 Koopas , Hip gets sent here, where he steals a TV station and refuses to come off until all the North Americans give him their money. South America [ edit ]
A largely tropical continent, South America is famous for the Amazon rainforest. Countries include Argentina, of which Buenos Aires is the capital. "" 7 Continents for 7 Koopas "" portrayed a part of South America's human population as primitive, spear-chucking hunter-gatherers. In 7 Continents for 7 Koopas , Hop is sent to the Amazon, where he turns the jungle into a parking lot. This may reference to loss of wood in the Amazon, among other rainforests. One of the continent's main cities, Rio de Janeiro , in Brazil, is also the main setting for Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games , where the 2016 Summer Olympics takes place. History [ edit ] Extinction of the Dinosaurs [ edit ]
The Super Mario Bros. film features an introduction that outlines the rule and extinction of the dinosaurs on Earth. Dinosaurs used to live the good life, superior to the small mammals who also inhabited the planet, until one day a gigantic meteor struck the planet, destroying the dinosaurs. They were divided into 3 periods. However, the narrator then asks the audience to consider a ""what-if"" scenario that paves the way for the remainder of the film.
As the plot of Super Mario Bros. is a ""what-if"" scenario, the applicability of this piece of Earth's history to the rest of the Super Mario series is unknown. Nintendo has yet to comment on this matter. Super Mario Bros. Plumbing [ edit ]
In some representations of the Mario brothers, including The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! , Mario and Luigi lived on Earth (sometimes referred to as the ""Real World"") and ran a Brooklyn plumbing business: Mario Brothers Plumbing , but later arrived in the Mushroom Kingdom via a Warp Pipe. Many of the brothers' relatives lived on the planet as well, including Mama Mario and Papa . Mario and Luigi's plumbing business was moderately successful.
How the brothers came to leave Earth in these portrayals of them is somewhat inconsistent. As revealed in "" The Legend ,"" the brothers left Earth for the Mushroom Kingdom upon hearing a call for help through the pipes in Mario Brothers Plumbing. According to the introduction to The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! and "" Toddler Terrors of Time Travel ,"" the brothers happened upon a Warp Zone to the Mushroom Kingdom while performing a house call, and were sucked down. This second explanation was later modified through the power of Ludwig von Koopa 's Time Travel Tube , but no major changes were made to Earth's history.
The games Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island , Yoshi's Island DS , and Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time have all confirmed that Baby Mario and Baby Luigi lived in Mushroom Kingdom. This conflicts with the explanation that Mario and Luigi are from Brooklyn. Mario Kart series [ edit ] Various characters racing across Earth. This artwork was made for Mario Kart DS , and it refers to the worldwide Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.
Official artwork for Mario Kart DS depicts various characters racing and battling on the Earth's surface, visually demonstrating the worldwide scope of the Nintendo DS ' Wi-Fi capabilities. In Mario Kart Wii , Earth appears while the player is waiting in the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and in the Rainbow Road course of the Special Cup . The planet is located in the background of the course, underneath the track. If the players accidentally fall off the course, they will fall to the void by the gravity of the planet, instead of floating in space. In Mario Kart 7 , like Mario Kart Wii , Earth appears while the player is waiting in the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. It is also there in the Mario Kart Channel. In Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe , Earth is still shown when the player plays online. Also, like Rainbow Road in Mario Kart Wii , Mario Kart 8 's Rainbow Road is set above Earth, along with a Blooper spaceship and MKTV satellites floating in space. Other appearances [ edit ]
Wario refers to the area below the Awazon as ""deep within the Earth"" in the manual of Virtual Boy Wario Land .
In Mario Party 7 and Mario Party 8 (in a minigame in the latter), the Earth can be seen. In Mario Party DS , there is a minigame where players run on a globe and shoot opponents.
In Super Paper Mario , on Chapter 7-3 if either Mario, or company jumps on the giant cloud "" Cyrrus "", they will be sent into orbit and back down to Earth which is seen in the background.
In The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! , Mario and Luigi often try to find their way back to Brooklyn (their hometown in the cartoon series) usually via a Warp Pipe . Towards the end of the series, the Mario Brothers decide to stay so that they can protect Princess Toadstool and the Mushroom Kingdom . Additionally, the live action sequences take place in Brooklyn. The first and last parts of the Super Mario Bros. film are also set in Brooklyn.
Additionally, in The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 , many episodes featured characters using Warp Pipes to travel back and forth between the ""Real World"" (Earth) and Mushroom Kingdom.

Earth or Planet Earth is a planet that features a wide variety of people, cultures, and ecosystems. While the Earth that appears in Super Mario has some features derived from the nonfictional entity, fictional alterations to the planet have been applied in the series. The planet has been referred to as the "" Real World "" by citizens of the Mushroom Kingdom in the cartoons . However, this is no longer addressed in recent material, meaning that the real ""Earth"" and the Mario version of Earth are now instead considered as being the one and the same.
Planet Earth is featured as the setting of the Mario & Sonic series, in which species from the Mario games are also present on Earth. It also is the setting of Mario is Missing! , in which Luigi must travel around the globe on a hunt to rescue Mario and save the world. Contents Lands of Earth Original map of the real world.
Earth is organized into seven continents whose borders are based on geographical features rather than political boundaries. Continents are not necessarily separated by water. With the exception of Antarctica , each continent is further subdivided into countries, political bodies ruled by a government. Several countries are in more than one continent. The subdivisions of countries vary, but every country has population centers such as towns or cities. Africa
Africa is home to both sandy deserts and lush rain forests. Its nations include but are not limited to Egypt , Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and Ethiopia. Humans and a variety of exotic animal species inhabit this continent. In the The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 episode 7 Continents for 7 Koopas , Kooky goes to Africa, where he turns all the animals there into stuffed animals. Antarctica
Antarctica is a large icy, ferociously cold desert continent located at the southernmost point of the planet, mostly populated by penguins . It is the only continent that does not have specific countries ruling portions of it; however, it has territories that are owned by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom. There are also some islands along the Antarctic plate that are associated with the continent of Antarctica; these are claimed by Australia, Norway, France and South Africa. In 7 Continents for 7 Koopas , Big Mouth is sent to Antarctica, where he builds an Abominable Snowkoopa that goes around scaring penguins. In Mario is Missing! , Bowser attempts to melt Antarctica in a plot to flood Earth. Asia
The largest continent, Asia is home to a variety of countries, including Japan , China and India. The Great Wall of China is one of the continent's most famous landmarks. In 7 Continents for 7 Koopas , Bully is sent here and does graffiti on it. China's nation capital, Beijing , was the location of the Olympic Games in which Mario , Sonic the Hedgehog , and others competed during the events of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games . Oceania
The smallest continent on Earth and its largest country is Australia , which is home to a variety of animal species, including Kangaroos . Alligator Dundee originally lived on this continent. It is often referred to as ""down under"" due to its location in the southern half of the planet. In 7 Continents for 7 Koopas , Cheatsy is sent here and he turns almost all the humans into kangaroos, except one of them, of whom he turns into a shrimp, where all the crocodiles (which are standing up) go ahead and chase him to eat him up. Europe
Europe shares a land mass with Asia, separated from it by the Ural Mountains. Famous for its varied culture and large role in Earth's history, Europe is divided into countries such as France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Italy. Famous cities include Paris and Venice . In 7 Continents for 7 Koopas , Kootie Pie is sent to the Louvre in France, where she turns famous paintings into paintings of her (Mona Kootie Pie, etc).

Earnings are expected from a third of S&P 500 companies in the week ahead, and there will also be an important report card on the economy, with second-quarter GDP expected to be the strongest in four years.
""> President Donald Trump made plenty of headlines in the past week, and fallout from some of those could appear in the week ahead. Traders will be watching China early Monday to see what kind of move occurs in its currency. Trump on Thursday and Friday criticized China and Europe for driving down their currencies at the expense of the dollar. The dollar lost about 1 percent on his comments over two days.
Trump also said in an interview with CNBC that he might slap tariffs on $500 billion in Chinese goods , a comment that weakened stocks Friday, but stocks ended the day little changed. For the week, the S&P 500 was barely positive, up 0.02 percent, but it squeaked out a third weekly gain and held above the key 2,800 level, closing Friday at 2,801.
“It could have been a lot worse,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. “The market’s trying to do everything it can do to get going. We have Google on Monday, Amazon on Wednesday. Will there be any kind of FOMO [fear of missing out]? Will there be more upside, or with strong reports are most of the gains priced in?”
Redler said if there are some really strong earnings, that may help propel the S&P well above 2,800 toward the range of its all-time high at 2,872.
About 170 S&P companies and 11 Dow companies report earnings, and earnings growth is expected to be about 20 percent for the quarter. Some of the names reporting include AT&T and Verizon, reporting on Tuesday; Facebook, General Motors, Ford and Boeing on Wednesday; McDonald’s, MasterCard and Starbucks on Thursday, and Exxon Mobil and Chevron on Friday.
Second-quarter GDP on Friday is expected to come in at 4.1 percent, according to the median forecast in the CNBC/Moody’s Analytics rapid update. That would be the highest since the third quarter of 2014.
© Provided by CNBC But Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said there could be some surprises in the data, given that the government is releasing a five-year benchmark revision to eliminate residual seasonality that has been depressing first-quarter growth.
As a result, Zandi said first quarters could see upward revisions of a half point, while second quarters could be revised down a half point and the third quarters could be adjusted down by about a quarter point. Taking that into account, he expects growth of 3.6 percent for the second quarter of 2018.
Zandi said growth should remain strong for the next couple of quarters.
“I think the next year should be very strong because of all the fiscal stimulus,” he said. “It’s a lot of juice right now into the middle of next year.”
Tariffs and trade wars, however, are a risk for the economy. “It depends on which road we go down. If all that happens is the tariffs that are actually implemented are the ones implemented and that’s the end of it, no big deal. That shaves a tenth of a percent off growth in the coming year,"" Zandi said. ""If all the tariffs the government has threatened [excluding the threat on $500 billion in Chinese goods were implemented] that would shave about a half point off growth in the coming year. You could come under the darkest scenario, if Trump does impose all the tariffs on the Chinese. That’s enough to push us into a technical recession in the second half of next year.""
Besides GDP, there is housing data, with existing home sales Monday and new home sales Wednesday. Philadelphia Fed manufacturing data is released Tuesday, durable goods Thursday and consumer sentiment Friday.
The European Central Bank meets Thursday, and that could be a chance for ECB President Mario Draghi to comment on Trump’s currency remarks during a press briefing.

In Texas, 110 degree weather is almost completely unbearable, and makes you want to spike your A/C bill just to stop sweating.
I made a fun list of a few of my must-have items to get me through ’til the leaves start to change, and we can all walk outside without immediately breaking a sweat. Of course, without breaking the bank!
(Click on the photo to shop my favs for summer!)
#1 Reusable Tumbler
This tumbler was such a steal! At $5.99 this 24oz reusable cup keeps your drinks cold, and will be the only thing not sweating this summer. You can even take a reusable cup like this one, into Starbucks and have them mix up your iced coffees and mango black tea lemonades in it, for $0.10 off your order! I got this adorable aqua colored one, but let’s be honest, if I’d seen the pink, it’d be mine.
#2 Dry Shampoo
Showering every day during the summer is a must, but washing your hair every day is a Catch 22. If you wash your hair too much (like every day) it will get super dry and unmanageable, not to mention, will be stripped of all of it’s natural oils that keep it healthy. But on the flip-side, if you don’t wash your hair (and don’t use a magical product like this one) your hair will be super greasy and stick to your scalp. Definitely not a cute look. This dry shampoo from Suave is another steal. At $4.99 for a 2 pack, there isn’t another dry shampoo on the market that will give your hair volume, a clean feeling, and smell like fresh citrus for this amazing price!
#3 Footbed Sandals
These Birkenstock knock-offs will be your go-to slide this summer. You can catch me wearing mine almost every day! I love how they are the perfect shade of beige, with the rose gold buckles, to make sure I stay on-trend. Not to mention, they’re extremely comfortable, even for a full day of photographer duties! At $22.99, they’re pretty hard to beat!
#4 Setting Spray
If you’re a girl like me, you probably don’t spend too many days out in public without makeup on. And when you have makeup on, you want it to stay ON. My two favorite setting sprays at the moment, go hand-in-hand for keeping my skin flawless all day!
First, the Urban Decay Quick-Fix Hydra-Charged Complexion Prep Priming Spray is definitely a mouth-full, but is THE best setting spray to use after moisturizer, before foundation/BB/CC cream! It smells amazing, and preps your skin to keep your makeup on all day long. It’s not the cheapest thing on this list, but a travel-size is only $15, not too bad!
The second setting spray I use is the E.L.F. Makeup Mist & Set. This $4 setting spray is pretty hard to beat! I definitely would compare this setting spray to the Urban Decay All-Nighter, if you’re looking for a cheaper alternative! I literally drench my face in this spray, especially during the summer, just to ensure that my makeup doesn’t budge!
#5 Denim Shorts
My all time favorite shorts for this hot weather have been these shorts from Universal Thread at Target! These Medium-Wash Destructed Mid-Rise Shorts have been my A1 pair of bottoms all summer. They’re so comfortable, have the perfect amount of stretch, are the perfect length, have 5 REAL pockets, and have maintained their shape, beautifully. They also come in straight sizes (00-18) and plus sizes (14W-26W), a size for almost everyone! Way to go, Target! Also, they’re on sale right now!
#6 Sunglasses
You HAVE to protect your eyes from this scorching sun! These sunnies are from Amazon, and very closely resemble the Ray-Ban sunglasses that brought the round, reflective shades back in style. These rose-gold pair are my absolute favorites for driving and just being outside in general. They’re only $12.99, come with a felt carrying case, a lens cleaning cloth AND are polarized! A serious steal.
#7 A Bucket Bag
Bucket bags are the new carry-all! Personally, I like to throw anything and everything I need into it. It kind of turns into a black hole at some point, but it can carry so much! I’ve even fit my entire DSLR camera, plus my necessities, without overflowing! Perfect for sneaking snacks into movies
Here’s one similar to my ultimate fav (which was a limited time bag for JustFab.com)
That’s all I’ve got!
Summer can be a super fun break from the reality of school and work, unless you’re me, doing both all summer long.
Don’t let the heat stop you from doing what you want!
Much love,
Sarah"

Whitney is a woman who greets you with, “Hello dahling.
The first time we spoke on the phone, I got a sense of her proper upbringing, tempered by her experiences in life. I think it’s those two, seemingly distinct poles that make her writing so appealing.
She refers to her writing as campfire stories. Whether she writes about writing as she’s done here at Two Drops of Ink , or in her books, Whitney references fire – a spark of inspiration, or a trial by fire.
She is published in numerous magazines such as Cruising World, Connecticut Magazine, YANKEE, Greenwich Magazine, Maine Boats and Harbors, and The Nautical Quarterly.

Whitney and her husband, Barry, have been married for forty-six years. They have just one child, a son who was born two weeks after they celebrated their twentieth year of child-free marriage.
At the time, they were brand-new in recovery from alcoholism, which is a family disease. For a while, it looked like the disease might win, but God won instead. Their son is now in graduate school, so they’ve relocated the family home to South Carolina."

Is it possible we could live in a world of ‘Uber everything’? Is it a world that would be better or worse for people? Senior RSG contributor John Ince tackles that tough question, plus bathroom woes for drivers, and Cargo’s new partnership with Uber in this week’s round up. Is Uber For Everything A Good Thing? [ Forbes]
Sum and Substance: A few months ago, Uber announced plans to launch UberEats in 100 new cities across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, bringing its global operations to around 300 cities. As Jason Droege, VP of Uber Everything – yes that’s his real title – explained, “I think it’s in Uber’s DNA to expand.” The food delivery division is on track to do $6 billion in bookings this year.
Earlier this month, Uber announced plans to invest in Lime, a California-based escooter company. Uber will brand and add Lime escooter service to its mobile app, giving customers another option for getting around cities, especially to and from public transit stations.
Given the company’s soaring ambition, are we destined to live in a world where Uber becomes the Amazon of urban transportation – the matchmaker for all intracity vehicular movement? And is that a good thing? Let’s examine the pro and con arguments in sequence.
Uber’s drivers have struggled to earn a living wage, particularly those who rely on the company as a predominant source of income. Uber has been shrinking driver compensation for years in many urban markets in its quest for profitability, while lagging its competitors on driver satisfaction and retention . Uber has yet to prove that they have a sustainable business model, losing more money faster than any startup in history .
Unless and until Uber can address these existential threats – particularly the last — the company cannot survive, let alone prosper. So let’s stipulate for now that under new leadership, Uber is aware of and working towards a sustainable future on all fronts…
The customers for Uber’s core rideshare business have been exceptionally well served. To the chagrin of traditional taxi operators, Uber has delivered a cheaper, faster and more convenient alternative for tens of millions of riders… As a result, Uber has benefited low-income second shift workers, late night revelers, and many others historically constrained by limited travel options. Uber has thus created a number of positive externalities – i.e., benefits enjoyed by third-parties, including local real estate owners, restaurants, bars, shops and entertainment venues, all contributing to an expanded tax base. …
… Uber lost more than $4 billion last year, and has signaled the likelihood for continuing heavy losses going forward. If city governments impose stringent congestion taxes and/or minimum wage requirements, the company’s financial viability would be at risk. At a minimum, Uber would be forced to raise prices (perhaps considerably) and rein in its ambitious growth initiatives. Investors would undoubtedly be less inclined to provide new capital, perhaps scuttling Uber’s planned IPO in 2019. …
My Take: This is the best and most thorough article on Uber I’ve read in awhile. The basic thesis is worth serious consideration – is Uber trying to do too much? If we learned anything during the melodrama surrounding the ouster of former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, it was that Uber’s board and management are certainly not infallible.
Uber’s aggressive moves toward competition with public transit, food delivery, scooters, air taxis all are fine as long as there is some financial discipline around their moves. With investors still throwing money at the company, Uber apparently still is in expansion mode. That won’t continue indefinitely. This article explains why. Thousands of Uber drivers to get settlement checks [ CBS News]
Sum and Substance: Thousands of current and former Uber drivers will start receiving checks averaging $223 this week, thanks to a Federal Trade Commission settlement made last year with the ride-hailing concern. The FTC had sued Uber last year, claiming it mislead drivers with both false income estimates and misleading lease agreement terms.
Specifically, the FTC alleged that Uber had claimed that the annual median income for UberX drivers in New York was $90,000 and $74,000 in San Francisco. However, the agency said these claims were inflated by $20,000 to $30,000 annually. The median income in New York was actually $61,000 and $53,000 in San Francisco, according to the FTC. Less than 10 percent of UberX drivers were able to earn the amounts Uber claimed as its average.
Moreover, Uber’s “vehicle solutions program,” which helps drivers buy and lease cars, had claimed it could get consumers into purchase agreements for as little as $140 per week ($560 per month) and could arrange vehicle leases for as little as $119 per week ($476 per month). In reality, they paid $160 per week ($640 monthly) for leases and $200 per week ($800 monthly) to purchase cars through the program, according to the FTC.
… Notably, the settlement amount is apparently unrelated to actual claims for damages. FTC Commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen objected to the settlement when it was struck for this reason, claiming that consumer’s actual damages were likely to be less than the $20 million that the FTC received. However, the FTC now says nearly 88,800 drivers qualify for checks. With that substantial pool of claimants, the average check adds to less than the estimated loss that the FTC claimed the average Uber driver would have suffered in just a month or two, if that driver had relied on the site’s claims to buy or lease a car. …
Checks will be mailed this week, …
My Take: While it’s certainly good news for drivers that they’ll be getting settlement checks, it really makes you wonder about a legal system that takes over 3 years to figure things out and arrive at a settlement. Since this lawsuit was filed, an awful lot has changed. Uber has a new CEO. Some drivers are making less, and the entire pay structure has changed as fees are added, bonuses play a bigger part and per mile rates have dropped. It’s really difficult for such a cumbersome legal system to keep up with changes in the tech world. Uber driver caught peeing in bottle with passenger in car [ New York Post ]
Sum and Substance: An Uber driver was caught on video peeing into a bottle while driving a passenger around on Monday night.
Raichelle Carter was taking an Uber Pool ride, but was alone in the car when she caught the driver trying to surreptitiously sprinkle into a bottle while she was in the back seat of his minivan, she told The Post.
“I had my headphones in and was just trying to chill and unwind, and then I notice that we stopped moving. Then I see him unbuckling his pants and hear urine hit the bottle,” Carter fumed of the Monday night incident…
Uber officials said they banned the driver, whose named popped up as Avraham on Carter’s app, from the platform.
“This is completely inappropriate and a clear violation of our community guidelines,” said an Uber spokeswoman. “The driver’s access to the app has been removed.”
Taxi and Limousine Commission officials acknowledged that it can be hard for drivers to find the time and a place to urinate while on the job, but also pointed out that he could have used one of the 19 relief stands set up for TLC workers in Manhattan.
“The driver unquestionably used poor judgment in his desperation, and this is not condoned in the TLC’s rules,” said agency spokesman Allan Fromberg.
“The practical truth, however, is that despite the existence of 19 FHV relief stands in Manhattan alone, bathroom access is a real problem for drivers resulting in real health risks, and we encourage restaurants and other establishments to make their facilities available to drivers in need.”
My Take: Oh my! How many drivers have been in this guy’s situation? I know I have… but I’m happy to report I’ve never peed in a bottle with the passenger in the car. I hope you haven’t too. Because if you do, your days as a rideshare driver are numbered. Uber lays off 100 self-driving car operators in Pittsburgh [ CNBC.com ]
Sum and Substance: Uber is replacing the operators with 55 so-called “mission specialists,” technical specialists trained on both on-road and test track conditions. Uber said it hopes to return self-driving cars to the roads of Pittsburgh in the summer. Uber has laid off 100 self-driving car test drivers in Pittsburgh in the wake of a high-profile crash in Arizona.
The company is replacing them with 55 so-called “mission specialists,” technical specialists trained on both on-road and test track conditions, as it continues to scale back operations in the wake of the crash. …
Earlier this year, one of Uber’s autonomous car operators hit and killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona, while in autopilot mode. The company shut down operations and laid off 300 safety drivers in Arizona following the incident. It said it would instead focus its push toward autonomous vehicles in San Francisco and Pittsburgh. …
My Take: Having gotten burned in a PR firestorm after the traffic fatality caused by a negligent operator in Tempe, Arizona, Uber seems determined to learn from its mistake. That’s kind of the mantra in autonomous vehicles – everything is a learning opportunity and experience. I sure hope Uber learned its lesson, because any more fatalities could be fatal to the company’s ambitions in driverless cars. Your Uber could now come with snacks, drinks, electronics [ CNET.com ]
Editor’s Note: We’ve covered Cargo several times before (including a video here ), and even our very own John Ince has mentioned he’s ambivalent about it. But there’s nothing to be ambivalent about now – Uber and Cargo have partnered up to help drivers provide snacks and other goodies to passengers and help drivers earn extra money.
Drivers with other ridesharing companies, like Lyft, can also still use Cargo. Senior RSG contributor Christian Perea is also quoted in the article, so check it out and let us know how Cargo has helped you earn extra money!

by Davide Mana 2 Comments
Your wildest desire? No, OK, not a night with Cleopatra or Empress Theodora or Catherine of Russia (why are we always so fascinated by racy women?) Something actually possible . Try this one out for size: unlimited credit in the largest bookstore on the planet. Boy, I’d go nuts with that. And I just got the next best thing: a fat gift card on Amazon. And being a good guy at heart, and money being tight, I decided to invest a fraction in a gift for a friend, and then look for something real cheap for me. I ended up getting a cartload of books.
And is there something better than getting a ton of good books to read? Obviously, it’s telling your friends what great books you just bought.
First, the rationale about my gift idea – there are books, paper books, that cost less than a happy birthday card. Case in point – the Wordsworth Classics books. Granted, they are printed on cheap paper and the covers are nothing to write home about, but they are perfect travel books. Indeed I started buying them when I was a student, to carry in by bag and read between classes.So, I went through the Wordsworth Classics catalogu, and finally gave in to the temptation and got me a copy of The Count of Montecristo , a novel I positively hated when I attacked it in high school in its Italian version. But let’s admit it, there is something exquisitely perverse in reading Dumas père in English. The massive 1000 pages book will be delivered tomorrow, and I’m sure it’s worth the whole 2 euro and 40 cents I paid for it. For my friend’s gift I had set my sights on Virginia Woolf, so I got myself a copy of Mrs Dalloway , again a book I had read in Italian, and a copy of A Room of One’s Own – because I love books about writing written by writers.
Then I just started browsing.The Endeavour Press catalog is usually quite interesting if you are into history or historical fiction, so I got me a copy of John Gillingham’s The Wars of the Roses , because it’s shorter than Game of Thrones and it’s basically the same story, and a copy of Ernie Bradford’s The Mediterranean , that promises to be quite a read. Then, running through the also boughts I found a very cheap ebook copy of Tristan Gooley’s The Walker’s Guide to Outdoor Clues & Signs , that I think I’ll keep on my smartphone. I love Gooley’s book about the observation of nature – they are fun to read, and provide a lot of information that can be used to spice up stories.
The same goes for A Classical Education , by Caroline Taggart, that promises to allow me to bluff a knowledge of the classics I do not have. I already have Taggart’s book on grammar and I always found it particularly useful, so this one was a no brainer. Then I threw in Meddling Kids , that I have mentioned before, and finally, I put on top of these all the first omnibus of the Godstalker novels by P. C. Hodgell, that I have only as ebooks, and sometimes it’s nice to have a solid paperback on the nightstand.
Not a bad haul, all in all. And I also remembered to buy a gift for my friend. Now I only need to find the time to read all this stuff. Advertisements"

US health officials are warning people to avoid certain foods due to ongoing unrelated outbreaks of intestinal infections caused by bacteria, viruses and even parasites lurking in some of our food.
Hereâ€™s what to stay away from:
Pasta salad Hy-Vee, a Midwestern grocery store chain, has recalled a pasta salad that might be linked to at least 20 people getting sick from salmonella. Hy-Vee, based in Iowa, sold the 1-pound and 3-pound plastic containers of Spring Pasta Salad in eight states.
The states are Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota â€"" where the salmonella illnesses were reported â€"" and Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Wisconsin.
The product was produced between June 1 and July 13. The packages have expiration dates between June 22 and August 3.
Symptoms of salmonella begin 12 to 72 hours after a person is infected and inclu de diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramping. This can last about four to seven days, and most individuals recover without treatment. However, those who develop severe diarrhea may need to be hospitalized. Those who are very young, who are very old or who have compromised immune systems are most at risk for complications and severe cases of illness.
Raw turkey Salmonella is the culprit in 90 illnesses linked to raw turkey products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Agriculture.
The illnesses have been reported in 26 states since November. But health officials have not identified a brand, product or supplier as the source of the outbreak.
Patients who have been interviewed reported eating â€œdifferent types and brands of turkey products purchased from many different locations. Two ill people lived in a household where raw turkey pet food was fed to pets,â€ the CDC said.
In addition, samples of raw t urkey pet food, raw turkey products and live turkeys have tested positive for the outbreak strain of salmonella, which could mean the outbreak is â€œwidespread in the turkey industry,â€ the CDC said.
Cut melon Put down the fork and step away from cut melon or fruit salad mixes that contain it.
The US Food and Drug Administration is warning people in 23 states that the fruit may be contaminated with salmonella.
The outbreak has affected 60 people mostly in five Midwestern states, with about half of them hospitalized.
Cut watermelon, honeydew and cantaloupe as well as fruit salads containing these melons have been recalled in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
The fruits were sold in stores such as Walmart, Kroger, Walgreens, Sprout s Farmers Market, Costco and Whole Foods/Amazon.
Kelloggâ€™s Honey Smacks cereal Federal health officials want you to toss out all boxes of Kelloggâ€™s Honey Smacks. The warning is due to an outbreak of salmonella that has left 100 people sick in 33 states.
The cereal was recalled June 14, but one month later, another warning not to eat the cereal was issued after the FDA said it was aware that it was still available.
â€œRetailers cannot legally offer the cereal for sale and consumers should not purchase Kelloggâ€™s Honey Smacks cereal,â€ the agency said.
Swiss rolls Flowers Foods announced a recall of Swiss rolls because they may be contaminated with salmonella. The ingredient whey powder was recalled for possible contamination. There have been no reports of illness from Swiss rolls, according to the company.
Swiss rolls sold nationwide under the brand names Mrs. Freshleyâ€™s, Food Lion, H-E-B, Bakerâ€™s Treat, Market Square, an d Great Value have been recalled. Captain John Derstâ€™s Old Fashioned Bread distributed in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina have also been recalled, the company said.
Ritz Cracker Sandwiches MondelÄ""z Global LLC announced a voluntary recall of certain Ritz Cracker Sandwiches and other Ritz Bits products because they contain whey powder that has been recalled for possible salmonella contamination. The products are available nationwide.
The voluntary recall is a precaution, as no complaints of illness have been reported, the company said.
The recalled product list includes Ritz Bits cheese cracker sandwiches and mixed cookie and cracker variety packs.
McDonaldâ€™s salads As a precaution, McDonaldâ€™s has stopped selling salads in 3,000 locations in 14 states to try to contain an outbreak of cyclospora illness.
The states no longer selling these salads are Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Oh io, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Kentucky, West Virginia and Missouri.
To date, 163 cases have been confirmed in 10 states since May 1, according to the CDC.
The cyclospora parasite causes intestinal illness as a result of consuming contaminated food or water. Symptoms can begin a week or more after consuming the parasite. They include diarrhea and frequent, sometimes explosive bowel movements, according to the CDC. Those who are infected might also experience loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps or pain, nausea, gas and fatigue. Vomiting, headache, fever, body aches and flu-like symptoms can also occur.
The illness can last from a few days to a few months, and patients might feel better but then get worse again. Patients can be treated with antibiotics.
Vegetable trays Before you grab something off that vegetable tray, make sure it hasnâ€™t been recalled.
The FDA is investigating at least 237 cases of cyclospora illnesses linked to recalled Del Monte Fresh vegetable trays. The trays contained broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and dill dip, and they were sold in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana.
â€œFDA has not identified which of the ingredients is the vehicle for this outbreak; each component of these vegetable trays is under consideration,â€ the agency said.
Cyclospora cayetanensis is a microscopic parasite that contaminates food or water and, when ingested, causes an intestinal illness. Symptoms include diarrhea, with sometimes explosive bowel movements, loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps, bloating, nausea and fatigue.
Imported crab meat Avoid eating fresh crab meat from Venezuela. Thatâ€™s the advice from the FDA due to an outbreak of Vibrio parahaemolyticus that started in April. In all, 12 illnesses have been reported in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Louisiana and the District of Columbia.
â€œThis product is commonly f ound in plastic tubs and may be labeled as â€˜pre-cooked,â€™ â€ the FDA said in its outbreak announcement.
Symptoms usually begin 24 hours after consuming the bacteria. They include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, fever and abdominal pain. Twelve people have become sick.

Mentioning you went through the setup several times already, you may have done these things already - but including some general discovery troubleshooting just so you can double check!
Delete and re-download the manufacturer's companion app (if applicable) for your smart home device, and complete device setup. Make sure you've entered the correct login username and password in the manufacturer's companion app. Mobile devices default to capitalizing the first letter of a word when typing in a field box. If your password doesn't start with a capital letter, make sure the mobile app doesn't accidentally capitalize it. Also, make sure there's no blank space before or after the username. Restart your Alexa device and your smart home device. Disable and re-enable the skill for your smart home device in the Alexa app. Disconnect your smart home device using the Disable option in the Smart Home section. Then, re-enable your smart home device again. Now about those router settings - I have a few suggestions. Some smart home devices only work with the 2.4 GHz band, so if your router is dual band, make sure you are using the 2.4 GHz band. You can also try turning on SSDP/UPnP on your router. This is generally done on a computer, and if you need more help with either of these, Asus would be in the best position to get you the information you need!
Also - you do not mention which Alexa device you are using, but just in case it's an Echo Show, I found this information from Ring Support with the specific steps about enabling the Ring Video Doorbell that you may find useful ( Click Here ).

Williamson focuses on the lingering effects of '60's protesters. He concludes: ""The radicals of 1968 thought they were getting a revolution. What they got was involution, a generational retreat into childish self-absorption. Turn on, tune in, drop out."" While reading, I sensed the article was implying, although Williamson didn't go there, that national unity is virtually impossible in a multi-cultural society. That certainly seems to be the case at present. I hope I'm not putting words into his mouth. Since it's contested while I'm out trying to sell books, I don't get to see the British Open. I just read the good news that a goombah has won it. Italy's Francesco Molinari, 35, who had his first victory on U.S. soil earlier this month, outlasted big names: McIlroy, Rose, Woods and Spieth. Bravo!
It was one of those sessions when the floating book shop was worth the effort despite meager returns. My thanks to Raffaella, who spotted Side Effects by her mom's favorite, Woody Allen, which also led to the woman purchasing Gregory Maguire's Confessions of an Ugly Step Sister for her precocious child. Soon Kaline came along, speaking on his cell phone, which he hung up to take a look at the wares. I call him that because his favorite ball player of all-time was the Detroit Tiger's Hall of Fame rightfielder. I hadn't seen him in ages. I took a chance and dug out an Eddie Matthews bio, which I was sure he already had, since he has more than ten thousand books on baseball. Lo and behond, he didn't have it. He recently went through a very rough patch involving a woman he'd first met 44 years ago. He fell in love, and she proceeded to steal from him. He took her to court but the case was dismissed because she was on welfare and food stamps. It sent him into a mental tailspin that required therapy. Kaline is one of these guys who is very good at making money. Well past retirement age, he is still doing income tax returns. When the record shops began going out of business, he bought up a lot of their wares and makes a ton selling it. He has a bat Babe Ruth used, which he bought when he was eleven, and which he estimates is worth a million bucks. Thank you, sir. Soon Bob approached, saying: ""I owe you a ton."" Last week I told him I'd eschewed cable and gone to an indoor TV antenna. He had an old one in his apartment, hooked it up, and it's currently bringing in 45 channels. He plans to get a better one and a co-axial cable, which the guy in the video I watched recommended. Only a few days ago he had a defibrillator installed. He pulled his T-Shirt down a bit and showed me his doctor's handiwork. As we were conversing, Bad News Billy showed. He's scheduled for the same surgery - at Coney Island Hospital, a facility that does not inspire confidence. Bob gave him information about his man, who's regarded as one of the best in his field and is associated with St. Luke's Hospital, part of the Mt. Sinai empire. Bob bought non-fiction by Aldous Huxley and Alexander Woolcott. My thanks.

Ttue love is strong enough to battle any fight and get out of there as the winner…
Have a look at the blurb: What’s wrong with my butt?
She means those words to be directed toward the woman beside her, not him. But he can’t stop himself from answering. Not when her ass is the most magnificent thing he’s seen in his life.
Apparently, answering her with ‘not a damn thing’ wasn’t what she was expecting.
She likely wasn’t expecting the baseball she took to the face at his next at bat, either.
All it takes is one ill-fated foul ball, and George Hoffman, Lumberjacks center fielder, falls head over heels in love with Wrigley Field—and yes, that is her real name.
From that point forward, George and Wrigley fall into a fast whirlwind love that ends with them eloping to Vegas. And he has his potty mouth, titty bar owning, pain in the ass grandmother to thank for it.
Not that he’s complaining or anything.
Who wouldn’t want to be married to a woman that made his heart race like he was in the final game of the World Series?
The only problem is trying to convince her of that.
#MyReview: I’ve been wanting to read a book from this author for quite some time but other books were pilling up and I didn’t had time to do so, and now that I have an opening I just want to dig in and fall in love.
Lani Lynn Vale has a simple and steamy writing full of feelings and sassyness into the mix. It’s like a breath of fresh air that I didn’t knew I needed.
Quit Your Pitchin’ is her latest release and tells the stories of George and Wrigley. This book is the second book from the There’s No Crying in Baseball series and I advise you to read book 1 first.
Wrigley was taken to a baseball game, against her will, but for her sister she would do everything, and couldn’t imagine the turn her life was about to get when one ball hit her right in the eye…
George is a baseball player that lives and loves this sports. He really enjoys what he does and he’s very good at that. He’s loved but everyone and he just knows it.
I really loved this book. I’m still smiling.
The plot is amazing, very well written, super engaging and intense. Each chapter made me want to keep reading forever and thinking about stopping was out of the picture.
When I started reading this book I thought that it would be a sweet book, with an instant chemistry without any bumps on the road but I was so wrong…
Why do people get happy when they hurt someone? Why are surrounded by greedy people that only want money or something else?
The chemistry between the characters is beautiful despite all the trouble surrounding them and let me just say that I got really mad while reading a few scenes.
I’ve laughed so hard but I’ve also cursed. Jeez… There were parts of the story that I saw myself wanting to hurt someone really bad…
It was like riding a bumpy rollercoaster that I wanted to get out but didn’t want to at the same time. Confusing right?
I’m sad that I haven’t read the first book from this series but I really need to…
Lani this book amazed me. I was instantly hooked and didn’t wanted it to end.. What’s next?
I voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book.

Roland Quandt Samsung is reportedly planning to release a two-in-one charger for its smartphones and the upcoming Galaxy Watch. Packaging for the Wireless Charger Duo has leaked ahead of Samsungâ€™s Unpacked press conference, which will be held at Barclays Center on August 9th.
The Wireless Charger Duo box reveals that itâ€™s capable of charging either two Qi-compatible phones simultaneously or one phone and the Galaxy Watch. Both placement areas support fast wireless charging. The upcoming Note 9 is rumored to feature a 4,000mAh battery, and Samsung has registered a new wireless charge r that could improve upon the already-fast wireless recharge capabilities of recent Galaxy smartphones. Itâ€™s not yet clear whether the Wireless Charger Duo will be capable of that higher output.
After early rumors hinted at Samsung making a return to Googleâ€™s Wear OS with its next smartwatch, thatâ€™s looking less and less likely. The Galaxy Watch is believed to again run the companyâ€™s own Tizen software.
The Wireless Charger Duo comes as Apple continues working away on its AirPower mat, which was first announced at last Septemberâ€™s iPhone event. While two-way chargers are relatively common, Apple has said that AirPower will simultaneously charge three devices â€"" such as an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. In June, Bloomberg reported that Apple has faced â€œa series of technical hurdlesâ€ during the course of AirPowerâ€™s development, such as making sure the charging mat doesnâ€™t overheat and working with its â€œcomplexâ€ circuitry.
Aga in, Samsungâ€™s Wireless Charger Duo just covers two devices at once. The companyâ€™s Icon X earbuds donâ€™t support wireless charging as of yet. But if youâ€™re planning to pick up both the Note 9 and Galaxy Watch, it might prove a convenient (albeit probably very pricey) accessory.

(e-books) While the iPhone is pretty small, you can set the Kindle app for larger print. I find it handy for reading in, say, the dentist’s office, or when waiting somewhere for my wife to finish shopping.
I have bank specific apps for my accounts and credit cards. I find it an easy way to keep tabs on them. You can set your credit card app, for example, to notify you of any charge over whatever number you set. You can deposit checks via the app.
I read the New York Times, so I have an app for that. I like Google News, too. I have had National Geographic, too. Etc. (For iPad tho you could get it for the iPhone I suppose. It’d be pretty small tho.)
For guys and gals on this forum, check out CCW-Concealed Carry 50 State for the latest on CCW reciprocity. There are a bunch of CCW apps.
I have several photography apps.... You can add filters and other effects after taking pictures.
Skype is good for video and telephone calls. In the iPhone you have FaceTime, which does the same thing with other people who have Apple products. I use FT audio a lot with my family members as, when in WiFi range, it is clearer than my cell service. It’s free.
if you have a non smart TV, you can set up Netflix and/or Amazon Prime streaming video on your phone, and connect to your TV with an HDMI cable. (Or AppleTV for wireless, but you need to buy the device. HDMI cables are cheap.)
And Yelp. It’s good for finding good restaurants or other businesses as customers supply reviews, kinda like Amazon.
Lyft and Uber for ride hailing services. Most cities have public transportation apps that tell you how to get around and when buses and subways, etc. are arriving.
It’s endless, really. Just try Googling “Best apps for ___"

Passt auf mit dem Angebot. Sonst kommt wieder Professor Mefun mit seinen genauso teueren Vergleichen und mahnt euch ab XD. Wobei empfehlen kann man den Stick nicht mehr. Dafür ist die Technik wirklich schon zu alt und das Android auch. Dann kann man sich auch den Amazon Fire Stick I’m Angebot für den Preis holen. Der hat dann wenigstens neueres Android drauf. Allerdings funktioniert da KODi und Co. nur mit kleinen Tricks. Gefällt mir 0 Gefällt mir nicht Antworten 5 Stunden 22 Minuten her Gast Guest
Android 4.4 is an old OS, many apps have stopped supporting it 1GB Ram is very basic, and the processor isn’t exactly the latest in cutting edge technology.
That said, it does come with its own remote control, although a RC with air mouse would be better.
I suggest this is a much better buy if you have to have a stick: https://www.ebay.de/itm/H96-Pro-4K-Android-7-1-Octa-Core-Mini-PC-TV-Stick-Dongle-Wifi-Bluetooth-HDMI/132576523327?hash=item1ede2d343f:g:wTEAAOSwUqBazLsc
But I prefer an Android box, something like this:

Ich bewerte jetzt nicht den angebotenen oder die in den Links aufgeführten Sticks. Aber ich habe Erfahrung mit einzelnen der Sticks in den Links. Manche funktionieren überhaupt nicht. Bei anderen sind die aufgespielten Apps unbrauchbar. Einzelne kann man zwar durch aufspielen von alternativen Betriebssystemen einigermaßen vernünftig zum laufen bringen, aber das erfordert einiges Wissen und viel Arbeit. Solch aufzählende Links bringen also garnichts. Wenn ihr kritisiiert, dann bitte mit konkreten Beispielen und nachprüfbaren Angaben (z.B. Foren die sich mit dem Gerät befassen). Ich halte übrigens auch nichts von den Marktführern /Goo, Fire,usw.) mit ihren kastrierten Möglichkeiten. Gefällt mir 0 Gefällt mir nicht Antworten 1 Monat 20 Tagen her Gast

Update: das Set ist heute noch mal bei eBay vertreten.
Der MediaMarkt hat gerade einen 20 Meter Gardena Schlauchwagen-Set für 44,95€ inkl. Versand im Angebot. Der Schlauchwagen bietet bequemen Transport und schonende Aufbewahrung und kommt fertig montiert mit 13 mm (1/2“)-Schlauch und Original GARDENA Systemteilen und Spritze.
Im Preisvergleich werden sonst 56€ verlangt, hier könnt ihr also gute 11€ einsparen . Bei Amazon gibt es von über 570 Rezensionen gute 3,7 von 5 Sternen , was ich aber absolut okay finde.

With ThrillerFest firmly in our rearview mirror and our writing bucket full of inspiration, we turn to ITW Members Alan Jacobson , Dani Pettry , Patrick Oster , Jay Brandon , Robert J. Stava , Paul D. Brazill , Kim Alexander , Sarah Simpson , William Boyle , David Orange and Lisa Black as they discuss how they choose their character’s names. Scroll down to the “comments” section to see what they have to say!
Alan Jacobson is the award-winning, USA Today bestselling author of a dozen books featuring FBI profiler Karen Vail and the OPSIG Team Black covert ops group. His 20+ years of research and training with the FBI, DEA, ATF, SWAT, Scotland Yard, and the US military infuse his books with verisimilitude. His novels have been optioned by Hollywood and both series have been raved about by federal agents, police captains, FBI profilers, and Navy SEALs.
A veteran of the NYC advertising business, Robert J. Stava is a horror & science fiction writer living in the Hudson Valley, apparently not far from the village where many of his stories are set: Wyvern Falls. His last novel, Nightmare From World’s End, was published by Severed Press in 2016 and his next science fiction-horror novel, Neptune’s Reckoning , set in Montauk, is due out the end of 2018. His short stories have appeared in various anthologies over the last several years and he has also authored one YA novella, The Devil’s Engine, published by Muzzleland Press. He’s also a musician, artist and historian. His non-fiction book Combat Recon was published in hardcover by Schiffer Publishing in 2008, encompassing the history and photography of his great uncle John Stava, a combat photographer with the 5th Air Force in the SW Pacific during WWII.
Always a deep thinking child, Sarah Simpson supposed that one day – she’d become a writer. So many hours consumed by reading, lost in the fantasy worlds of Enid Blyton. Always a people watcher, wondering what is ensuing behind the eyes. But as is often the case, life gripped her hand, and led her along a different path. She graduated first with a business degree and then with a psychology degree. After completing post-graduate studies, Sarah worked as a therapist within the varied field of mental health. This path has gifted her an invaluable understanding of life and of people. Now a writer; she could never have been without these experiences. She wanted to write about life and as with her debut novel, HER GREATEST MISTAKE – perhaps travel the darker aspects of life and relationships.
Praised by New York Times best-selling author Dee Henderson as “a name to look for in romantic suspense,” Dani Pettrey has sold more than 400,000 copies of her novels to readers eagerly awaiting the next release. Dani combines the page-turning adrenaline of a thriller with the chemistry and happy-ever-after of a romance. Her novels stand out for their “wicked pace, snappy dialogue, and likable characters” ( Publishers Weekly ), “gripping storyline[s],” ( RT Book Reviews ), and “sizzling undercurrent of romance” ( USA Today ).
Paul D. Brazill’s books include Last Year’s Man, Guns of Brixton, Small Time Crimes , and Kill Me Quick . He was born in England and lives in Poland. His writing has been translated into Italian, Polish, German and Slovene. He has been published in four editions of The Mammoth Books of Best British Crime. He has also edited a few anthologies, including the best-selling True Brit Grit.
William Boyle is from Brooklyn, NY. His newest novel, THE LONELY WITNESS, is out now from Pegasus Crime. His first novel, GRAVESEND, will be reissued by Pegasus Crime in September 2018. He lives in Oxford, Mississippi.
Patrick Oster , now writing fiction full time, was a managing editor at Bloomberg News and editor-in-chief of the National Law Journal . He has worked as a journalist for Business Week in Europe , Knight Ridder in Mexico and covered the White House, State Department, the Supreme Court and the CIA as Washington Bureau Chief of The Chicago Sun-Times . He is the author of the nonfiction book The Mexicans , a Book-of-the-Month selection. His award-winning comic thriller The Commuter was published by the Argo Navis imprint of Perseus Books. He also wrote the spy thriller The German Club and the cyber-thriller The Hacker Chronicles . His latest novel is The Amazon Detective Agency , a murder mystery. He is a member of the International Thriller Writers.
Jay Brandon is the author of 18 novels. His previous novel, Shadow Knight’s Mate , has been called “an absorbing, exciting, and absolutely entertaining novel.” His earlier novels include Fade the Heat , which was an Edgar finalist and published by more than a dozen foreign publishers. He has a master’s degree in writing from Johns Hopkins University.
Kim Alexander grew up in the wilds of Long Island, NY and slowly drifted south until she reached Key West. After spending ten rum-soaked years as a DJ in the Keys, she moved to Washington DC, where she lives with two cats, an angry fish, and her extremely patient husband who tells her she needs to write at least ten more books if she intends to retire in Thailand, so thank you for your patronage.
David Orange , veteran actor, has co-starred twice on Broadway and has had several memorable film roles including the “Sleepy Klingon” in the hit film Star Trek VI in addition to performing in 300 television commercials and guest roles on TV shows. He also has had 25 articles published in wine and entertainment magazines and two novellas published by small presses.
Lisa Black has spent over twenty years in forensic science, first at the coroner’s office in Cleveland Ohio and now as a certified latent print examiner and CSI at a Florida police department. Her books have been translated into six languages, one reached the NYT Bestseller’s list and one has been optioned for film. The first two, written as Elizabeth Becka, were followed by seven Theresa MacLean forensic thrillers. Her current Gardiner & Renner series includes That Darkness, Unpunished, Perish, and, in August 2018, Suffer the Children.

Reviewing my photos, I realized I had a bunch of little odds & sods that I could write up as a post, so here we go!
Refrigerator Fan Update
The fan I installed a few years ago started to get annoyingly loud. A recent post on the FB group about this very topic prompted me to get it in gear and fix this issue.
I ordered a couple of Antec fans, based on the recommendation from Steve, and they soon magically appeared on our doorstep. As I wanted to install both of them, I pondered another method of mounting. After examining the upper vent cover, I decided to mount them directly on the cover. In this manner, the fans are situated as far forward of the rising heat flow as possible, and as close to the grills as possible. These covers are quite secure, so I am not anticipating any issues with this setup.
The fans offer 3 speeds, so I went with medium to start. Leaving the quick disconnects in place means it will be easy to remove the cover completely away from the Alto if necessary.
The fans run real quiet, a nice change from the noise the previous one was making.
For those interested, here is the fan used.
https://www.amazon.ca/Antec-TriCool-DBB-Switch-Monitor/dp/B00066ISES/ref=sr_1_27?ie=UTF8&qid=1532291577&sr=8-27&keywords=antec+cooling+fan
Solar Panel Recaulking
The caulking around the edges of the solar panels was starting to look a little tired, and in some areas, seemed to be breaking down and crumbling. I cleaned up the edges by carefully removing any of the old caulking, taped accordingly to ensure a nice clean edge, then reapplied some fresh Adseal. The results look quite nice, and those edges look sharp.
Reese Friction Plate
I had some urethane windshield adhesive left over from another little job, so not to let go to waste, I looked over the Alto for areas that needed a little attention. I spied the friction plates for the weight distribution bars, that are glued to the top of the frame members.
Out came the masking tape, and the adhesive was soon back in tip top shape.
Aluminum Insulation Cover
I’m not really sure what to call this little part of our Alto. Being #80, we have a few things that perhaps are no longer included on later models, and this is definitely one of them.
From the back of the fresh water tank to the rear of the Alto, the section between the frame members has a solid piece of styrofoam filling the entire area. This was then covered with form fitting aluminum.
I’m not really certain what was being achieved here. Was it simply an attempt to add a little R factor right below the sleeping area, or was it something a tad more sophisticated like working on the under trailer airflow to achieve better aerodynamics. Whatever the real reason, I think one directly impacted the other.
The cutouts needed to accommodate the rear stabilizers, left the edge of the styrofoam exposed to the elements, and although I long ago knew this, only now is the problem being addressed. Perhaps the creation of my little bending brake made the job jump to the forefront again.
Sourcing some appropriate aluminum from my favourite metal shop, I pressed the bending brake into service to form some simple sides to enclose the area. These were then siliconed into places, some gap sealing happened, and the job was done.
Some stainless screws and washers were also used to further secure the edges of the aluminum, as the was a bit of sag happening, and that certainly was not going to be tolerated!

Libraries are the only good thing about this horrible country. Nothing beats my memories of borrowing R.L. Stein books and puppets when I was a poor little kid. I don't want to raise my children in a country that throws kids to the curb so that their natural drive to learn is milked by corporate shit heads who just want a quick buck.
Libraries are a testament to humanity's greatest potential. To be able to archive all of human knowledge, art, and achievement bundled with public classes, help for the downtrodden, bettering the lives of children, and providing a local space - free from profit - for communities to organize and show their own art and achievement. The only way to make this better is to supply libraries more: make all academic journals and legal documents public and increase their funding.
If knowledge is power, then a country which even pretends to care about democracy must make knowledge a public right. In fact, we shouldn't replace libraries with Amazon, we should replace Amazon with libraries."

What pisses me off is this bourgie cockstain has the gall to tell me that enriching further the most wealthy man in all of history is supposed to help me out, because I'll won't be spending the .0005 cents that goes to libraries from my taxes.
This isn't even written for me it's written for middle class scumfucks who want to feel better about the gating off poor people from our shared culture and history.
Last of all, the article is incredibly shittly written, like an over-enthusiastic high school libertarian, bare bones, barely literate sentences that don't even make a good case for replacing all libraries with amazon (not that you really could anyway). At best this article makes a case that amazon should also compete for a communities attention and to do this they need to build more of them. And at worst it tells me that Libraries exist, and so do Starbucks and they do similar thing sometimes. So why not amazon.
It's been a while since I've been so angry, fuck"

Well, hardcopies nowdays are meant mostly for middle-aged people or retirees.
I agree with the convenience of digital books, I do it as well, though I actually bought a couple hardcopies latelly.
But turning public libraries into amazon whoknowswat is just wrong.
Generally, I trully wish that healthy public sector rebounds.

Thank you so much for joining us this week! My summer has been filled with gardening, traveling and so many new experiences. Right now, I'm on my way to Delaware for a week. In between all of the trips, I'm waiting for a black swallowtail butterfly to emerge from its chrysalis in my greenhouse. This is the first time I've ever experienced something like this so I'm really excited! I'm also waiting for two praying mantis eggs to hatch. All of these beneficial insects are extremely important to my garden. I've also been enjoying making tea using ingredients harvested straight out of my garden. If you want to learn more about what kinds of plants to grow so you can do the same, read my latest blog post!
